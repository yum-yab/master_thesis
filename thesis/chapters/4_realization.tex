\section{Overview}

Explain what I want to do using the CMIP6 simulations: Describe what the general plan is: Visualisation of the moisture transport in Europe with the help . 
Also define what the goals of the visualisations are: Visualize different scenarios for comparison, visualize uncertainties of different members, visualize evolution over time, also try combining those. 
Here should be a graphic that explains the workflow that transforms a simulation into some nice pictures


\section{Preprocessing}

The goal of this step is to generate an IVT field (see Chapter \ref{ch:related_work}) from the MPI GE CMIP6 (see Chapter \ref{ch:dataset}). 
The steps to complete this task are quite straight forward:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Load four different fields for each time period in each member in each szenario: Specific humidity $hus$, eastward horizontal wind $ua$, northward horizontal wind $va$ and surface pressure $ps$. Here the geographical box around the area of interest is cut out: Europe and the North Atlantic (Longitude: $-90째 \to 40째$, Latitude: $20째 \to 80째$, based on \cite{vietinghoff_visual_2021})
  \item For each geographical gridpoint ($lon$, $lat$) and timestep: Calculate the integrals of hte product of wind components and specific humidity over the vertical pressure levels $\frac{1}{g}\int_{p_S}^0 hus * ua$ and  $\frac{1}{g}\int_{p_S}^0 hus * va$, with $g$ being the gravitational acceleration ($9.806 \frac{m}{s}$) 
  \item Save the results for each time period in each member in each szenario in a NetCDF file for the further steps. 
  
\end{enumerate}

The calculations were performed on the high performance computing cluster\footnote{https://docs.dkrz.de/doc/levante/} of the German Climate Calculations Center (DKRZ), due to the MPI GE CMIP6 is saved there and downloading the data would take a lot of time. 
This also result in the goal of this step to minimize the hours on the HPC system since they get billed by the time using nodes. 
Although these steps seem easy, due to the large sizes of the datasets and other issues many challenges were met. 
In the following those will be explained with regard to the step they ocurred in. 



\textbf{1. Data Loading}

\begin{itemize}
  \item cutting out geobox
  \item slow IO $\rightarrow$ started using dask+xarray 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Vertical integration}

\begin{itemize}
  \item calculate hybrid  sigma pressure levels for each gridpoint and timestep to get the x values for integration
  \item describe my idea of testing the integration
  
\end{itemize}


% This should explain how you get a proper IVT field from a CMIP6 simulation, what the caveats are and what calculations are done. 
%
%
%
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item intitial implementation in julia $\rightarrow$ computation was fast, but the slow IO was a problem 
%   \item also very established tools (like CDO) fail 
%   \item multiple ideas of optimising the IO:
%     \begin{enumerate}
%       \item Multiple different libraries - similar results
%       \item Parallel reading of different fields - no success or segmentation fault
%     \end{enumerate}
%     
%   \item after asking the helpdesk $\rightarrow$ problem was discovered (few byte transmissions) but not the reason for it 
%   \item helpdesk says that large portions of the datasets were never used
%   \item after investigating: Turns out Pythons xarray+dask was quite performant
% \end{itemize}
