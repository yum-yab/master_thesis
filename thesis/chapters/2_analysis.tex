\chapter{Problem Analysis}
\label{ch:analysis}

Explain what I want to do using the CMIP6 simulations: Describe what the general plan is: Visualisation of the moisture transport in Europe with the help . 
Also define what the goals of the visualisations are: Visualize different scenarios for comparison, visualize uncertainties of different members, visualize evolution over time, also try combining those. 
Here should be a graphic that explains the workflow that transforms a simulation into some nice pictures
