% This chapter builds on the foundation of Chapter \ref{ch:basics}, explaining what dataset is actually used, the reason for this and its properties. 
This section outlies the current state-of-the-art in the main parts of this thesis explained in Section \ref{sec:research_questions}: Qantifying Moisture (Transport), extracting spatio-temporal patterns, tracking their change over time and visualizing the uncertain results in the end.
% Furthermore, it summarizes the current state-of-science in quantifying and calculating (patterns of) moisture transport and the usage of it.  


\section{Uncertainty Visualisation}

\section{Moisture Transport}

This section should explain in what ways moisture transport can be quantified and used, give a few examples for each and maybe motivate  why we do it like we want to. 

To computationally extract any spatio-temporal patterns of moisture (transport), it first needs to be quantified in any way.
The variable usually used for this task is the \textit{specific humidity}, which has no unit and is a float value between 0.0 and 1.0, denoting the percentage of water in the air at a specific gridpoint. 
The vast majority of literature use some form of vertically integrated humidity and the variants will be explained in the following section.  \todo{Create a table showing how different quantification were used in different algorithms}
The main usage of these algorithms was to find a filamentary weather structure called \enquote{Atmospheric Rivers}, a prominent way of water vapor transportation in the extratropic regions \cite{gimeno_atmospheric_2014}. 


The most straightforward way of quantifying moisture is \textbf{Vertically Integrated Water Vapor (IWV)} \cite{gimeno_atmospheric_2014, schluessel_atmospheric_1990, bao_interpretation_2006, neiman_meteorological_2008, zhao_lagrangian_2021}, which is essentailly the vertical integral of the specific humidity $q$ from earth's surface to some upper limit in the atmosphere:

$$
\int^{P_s}_0 q dp
$$

\todo{Insert some examples of usages with references to the papers, indicating the usefulness}
% See Section \ref{sec:atmo-rivers} for further explanation. 


There are also some notable other algorithms, namely stable oxygen isotope investigation \cite{ma_atmospheric_nodate} and langragian backwards trajectories \cite{zhao_lagrangian_2021}, but both rather look for the origin of the WV instead of its destination and are therefor out of scope for this thesis.

% \subsection{Vertically Integrated Water Vapor (IWV)}

% \subsection{Vertically Integrated Water Vapor Transport (IVT)}

As proposed by \citeauthor{zhu_proposed_1998} in \cite{zhu_proposed_1998}, one way of measuring moisture ($p$) transport is by vertically integrating over the different pressure levels the zonal and meridional fluxes $\overline{pu}$ and $\overline{pv}$. 

An example of using this method can be found in \cite{ayantobo_integrated_2022} with many more references why this method is working well for these kinds of approaches. 

Also, this paper lists some other methods of moisture transportation which are also used

\begin{enumerate}
  \item integrated water vapor distributions
  \item the lagrangian approach
  \item stable oxygen isotope investigation
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Usages of IVT and differences}

In \cite{ralph_dropsonde_2017} they used a vector field of the IVT: $\int_{p_{low}}^{p_{max}} qV dp$, where $p$ is the pressure level, $q$ is the humidity and $V$ the horizontal vector.

In \cite{sousa_north_2020} they used a scalar field based on the euclidian norm of the vector field used by \cite{ralph_dropsonde_2017}.


In \cite{ayantobo_integrated_2022} they also used the euclidian norm on a similar field like \cite{ralph_dropsonde_2017} to measure the impact of  ENSO on south-chinese weather.
% They used it to measure the moisture and displayed the first graphics of the work, illustrating how an IVT map looks at a drought and during a flood.
% Also maps of the mean IVT during each months, displaying the intense raining/wet summers and dry winters

% \subsection{Moisture Budget}

\citeauthor{yang_moisture_2022} showed in their report \cite{yang_moisture_2022} the directions of moisture flux on the continent borders based on the big ERA5 reanalysis.
They measure the moisture based on a equation called the \textit{Moisture Budget}, which is based on multiple Faktors: 



It seems related to the IVT the other authors used, but utilizes the gradient and some other differences. The complete formula is:

$$
\frac{1}{g} \frac{\delta}{\delta t} \int^{P_s}_0 q dp = - \nabla \cdot \frac{1}{g} \int^{P_s}_0 (qv) dp + E - P
$$

With: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $p$ is the pressure, $P_s$ is the surface pressure
  \item $q$ is the specific humidity
  \item $v$ is the horizontal wind vector
  \item $E$ is the evaporation
  \item $P$ is the Precipitation
\end{enumerate}


In the actual analysis they used mostly other metrics:


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Vertically integrated Moisture Convergence (\textit{VIMC}): It is basically the gradient of the specific moisture in the air times the Wind vector
  \item $P$ is the precipitation 
  \item $E$ is the evaporation
\end{enumerate}

Furthermore, they evaluated the correlation between the moisture transport and the precipitation variability, which correlate to a significant extent.

%\section{Atmospheric Rivers}
%\label{sec:atmo-rivers}

\todo{I don't know where to put this, maybe it should go into the preliminaries}

This section should explain atmospheric rivers, but since we don't know if they are even relevant so i write it in the end. 

\section{Pattern analysis}

Explain some usages of EOF in data, but extremely important: Explain what \cite{ayantobo_integrated_2022} did since its quite similar. 

% \subsection{Empirical Orthogonal Functions}

See \cite{hannachi_empirical_2007} for a big overview of EOF in atmospheric science.

See \cite{ayantobo_integrated_2022} for a similar approach as we plan it, except it only focuses on the past.
