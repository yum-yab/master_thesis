\chapter{Related Work}
\label{ch:related_work}

% This chapter builds on the foundation of Chapter \ref{ch:basics}, explaining what dataset is actually used, the reason for this and its properties. 
This section outlies the current state-of-the-art in the main parts of this thesis explained in Section \ref{sec:research_questions}: Qantifying Moisture (Transport), extracting spatio-temporal patterns, tracking their change over time and visualizing the uncertain results in the end.
% Furthermore, it summarizes the current state-of-science in quantifying and calculating (patterns of) moisture transport and the usage of it.  


\section{Uncertainty Visualisation}

\section{Moisture Transport}

% This section should explain in what ways moisture transport can be quantified and used, give a few examples for each and maybe motivate  why we do it like we want to. 

To computationally extract any spatio-temporal patterns of moisture (transport), it first needs to be quantified in any way.
The variable from the MPI GE CMIP6 used for this task is the \textit{specific humidity}, which has no unit and is a float value between 0.0 and 1.0, denoting the percentage of water in the air at a specific gridpoint. 
The vast majority of literature regarding moisture transport use some form of vertically integrated humidity and the variants will be explained in the following section.  
% \todo{Create a table showing how different quantification were used in different algorithms}
A popular usage of these quantifications was to find a filamentary weather structure called \enquote{Atmospheric Rivers}\footnote{earlier or alternative name: \enquote{Tropospheric Rivers}}, a prominent way of water vapor transportation in the extratropic regions \cite{gimeno_atmospheric_2014}. 


The most straightforward way of quantifying moisture is \textbf{Vertically Integrated Water Vapor (IWV)} \cite{gimeno_atmospheric_2014, schluessel_atmospheric_1990, bao_interpretation_2006, neiman_meteorological_2008, zhao_lagrangian_2021}, which is essentailly the vertical integral of the specific humidity $q$ over the pressure levels $p$ from earth's surface $P_S$ to some upper limit in the atmosphere:


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:iwv}
IWV = \frac{1}{g} \int^{P_s}_0 q ~\diff p
\end{equation}

% \todo{Insert some examples of usages with references to the papers, indicating the usefulness}
% See Section \ref{sec:atmo-rivers} for further explanation. 



% \subsection{Vertically Integrated Water Vapor (IWV)}

% \subsection{Vertically Integrated Water Vapor Transport (IVT)}

Similar to Equation \ref{eq:iwv},  \citeauthor{zhu_proposed_1998} proposed in \cite{zhu_proposed_1998} a way of moisture transport by vertically integrating over the different pressure levels the zonal (along latitude lines) and meridional (along longitude lines) fluxes $\overline{pu}$ and $\overline{pv}$.
It became known by the name Vertical Integrated Moisture Transport (IVT) and has the unit $\frac{kg}{ms}$
Here $u$ and $v$ stand for the zonal and meridional components of the horizontal wind vector. 
It became a popular metric for finding atmospheric rivers \cite{gimeno_atmospheric_2014}, sometimes alongside IWV \cite{eiras-barca_seasonal_2016}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ivt}  
IVT = \frac{1}{g} \int^{P_s}_0 q ~\binom{u}{v} ~ \diff p
\end{equation}

While Equation \ref{eq:ivt} yields a vector field, the euclidian norm of said vector field 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ivtnorm}
\lVert IVT \rVert = \frac{1}{g} \sqrt{(\int^{P_s}_0 qu ~ \diff p)^2 + (\int^{P_s}_0 qv ~ \diff p)^2}  
\end{equation}

is also a popular choice in detecting atmospheric rivers \cite{sousa_north_2020, ramos_atmospheric_2016} and other use cases \cite{ayantobo_integrated_2022}.

An example of using this method can be found in \cite{ayantobo_integrated_2022} with many more references why this method is working well for these kinds of approaches. 

Also, this paper lists some other methods of moisture transportation which are also used

The IVT is also part of the atmospheric moisture budget \cite{yang_moisture_2022} (and similar in \cite{seager_mechanisms_2020}) given by 

$$
\label{eq:moisture_budget}
\frac{1}{g} \frac{\delta}{\delta t} \int^{P_s}_0 q ~ \diff p = - \nabla \cdot \frac{1}{g} \int^{P_s}_0 q ~\binom{u}{v} \diff p + E - P
$$

With $E$ being the total evaporation and $P$ the precipitation. 
\citeauthor{yang_moisture_2022} showed in their report \cite{yang_moisture_2022} the directions of moisture flux and its evolution in the last three decades. The analysis was done for all continental borders based on the big ERA5 reanalysis.
The metrics used for this analysis were mostly the evaporation $E$, precipitation $P$ and the moisture transport convergence  $VIMC = \frac{1}{g} \int^{P_s}_0  \nabla \cdot q ~\binom{u}{v} \diff ~ p$ from Equation \ref{eq:moisture_budget}.


There are also some other notable other algorithms, namely stable oxygen isotope investigation \cite{ma_atmospheric_nodate} and langragian backwards trajectories \cite{zhao_lagrangian_2021}, but both rather look for the origin of the  water vapor instead of its destination and are therefor out of scope for this thesis.

\subsubsection{Usages of IVT and differences}

In \cite{ralph_dropsonde_2017} they used a vector field of the IVT: $\int_{p_{low}}^{p_{max}} qV dp$, where $p$ is the pressure level, $q$ is the humidity and $V$ the horizontal vector.

In \cite{sousa_north_2020} they used a scalar field based on the euclidian norm of the vector field used by \cite{ralph_dropsonde_2017}.


In \cite{ayantobo_integrated_2022} they also used the euclidian norm on a similar field like \cite{ralph_dropsonde_2017} to measure the impact of  ENSO on south-chinese weather.
% They used it to measure the moisture and displayed the first graphics of the work, illustrating how an IVT map looks at a drought and during a flood.
% Also maps of the mean IVT during each months, displaying the intense raining/wet summers and dry winters

% \subsection{Moisture Budget}


Furthermore, they evaluated the correlation between the moisture transport and the precipitation variability, which correlate to a significant extent.

%\section{Atmospheric Rivers}
%\label{sec:atmo-rivers}

\todo{I don't know where to put this, maybe it should go into the preliminaries}

This section should explain atmospheric rivers, but since we don't know if they are even relevant so i write it in the end. 

\section{Pattern analysis}

Explain some usages of EOF in data, but extremely important: Explain what \cite{ayantobo_integrated_2022} did since its quite similar. 

% \subsection{Empirical Orthogonal Functions}

See \cite{hannachi_empirical_2007} for a big overview of EOF in atmospheric science.

See \cite{ayantobo_integrated_2022} for a similar approach as we plan it, except it only focuses on the past.
