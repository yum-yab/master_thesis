\section{Weather and Climate Simulation}

Explain here, on a general concept, what climate simulations/reanalysises are and how they are made. 
Not too specific, but also not too broad.
\todo{Find some literature to source this chapter!}

Points to touch:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What are ensemble simulations? Why are they necessary?
  \item What are reanalyses?
  \item What is usually contained in such a simulation? 
  \item How are they made? (General concept, not too specific)
  
\end{itemize}



\section{IPCC \& Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)}

In this section the polical/global aspect should be explained, but also how the global science community works together to build intercompareable projects. \cite{oneill_scenario_2016, riahi_shared_2017, touzepeiffer_coupled_2020}




Points to touch:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What is the relation of IPCC and CMIP?
  \item What are the SSPs?
  \item What are the specifications of the latest version? 
\end{itemize}

\section{Mathematical Background}

This section should explain the basic math to understand the aforementioned topics, not that much needed but still needs to be there.
