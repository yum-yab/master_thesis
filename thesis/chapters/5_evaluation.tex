\label{ch:results}

This chapter presents the results of the analysis described in the previous chapter. 
Comparing the results of 30 and 50 seasons per timescope revealed (similar to \cite{vietinghoff_visual_2021}) that using 30 winters is, in general, more noisy, but the results are structurally very similar. 
Therefore, only the smoother results of 50 winters per timescope are shown in this section. 

\section{Evolution of Patterns}
\label{sec:pattern evolution}

This Section gives an overview how the \ac{eof} patterns change over the time, also comparing the differences of the two chosen climate scenarios, which represent the extremes of climate change handling.   

\subsection{Evolution of Encoded Variability}
\label{sec:results encoded variance}


\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/mode_variability_psl_50seasons.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption[Explained Variability of PSL Modes]{Boxplot of the variability encoded in the top five modes of \ac{psl} \ac{eof}. Red line shows piControl run modes.}\label{fig:psl mode variability}
\end{figure}

The first simple evaluation is to look at the change in the share of variability encoded by each \ac{eof} (see Equation~\ref{eq:eof variance calculation}). 
The results are displayed in boxplots, with the colored bar being $50\%$  of the members. 
The whiskers are 1.5 the size of the interquartile range (distance between upper and lower and of the colored bar), any data point outside that is considered an outlier and represented with dots. 


Figure~\ref{fig:psl mode variability} shows that there is no striking change in the SSP126 scenario in any way. 
The five most significant modes stay pretty much the same across the studied 250-year time period, with the primary mode (\ac{nao}) encoding around $39\%$ (median) of the whole dataset variability in each time scope, with fluctuations of the interquartile range ($50\%$ of the data) introduced by the simulation members being around $\pm 2\%$, with no significant trend over the years. 
The median of the secondary mode (\ac{eap}) stays around $17\%$, with the quartiles being $\pm 1\%$. 
The median variability encoded by \acp{eof} 3,4 and 5 is around $13\%$, $8\%$, and $5\%$, respectively. 
Compared to the SSP585 scenario, it is obvious that there is very little or no change in Modes 3-5 and 1. 
But interestingly, the median variability encoded by the secondary mode rises from $17\%$ in the 1850 - 1900 scope to around $20\%$ in the last, exposing a clear trend over the course of climate change.   


\begin{figure}[hbt]

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/mode_variability_ivt_50seasons.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption[Explained Variability of IVT Modes]{Boxplot of the variability encoded in the top five modes of \ac{ivt} \ac{eof}. Red line shows piControl run modes.}
  \label{fig:ivt mode variability}
\end{figure}

The same analysis with the \ac{ivt} patterns (Figure~\ref{fig:ivt mode variability}) reveal a general upward trend in the primary mode of \ac{ivt}, from median $26\%$ in the first window to around $28\%$ in the last. 
This trend is very similar in both SSP126 and SSP 585. 
Modes 3,4 and 5 also look very similar in both evaluated scenarios, with a median encoded variability of $8\%$, $6\%$, and $5\%$. 
Similarly to Figure~\ref{fig:psl mode variability}, the secondary mode (representing around $15\%$ of variability) shows an upward trend in the scenario SSP585 to around $17\%$, which is not recognizable in the scenario SSP126. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/mode_variability_pr_50seasons.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption[Explained Variability of PR Modes]{Boxplot of the variability encoded in the top five modes of precipitation \ac{eof}. Red line shows piControl run modes.}\label{fig:pr mode variability}
\end{figure}

The dominant modes of precipitation \ac{eof} seem to account for far less of the total variance ($28.5 \%$ of the mean total variance of the top three modes at the beginning of the historical simulation), compared to the other patterns ($50 \%$ and $68 \%$ for \ac{ivt} and PSL, respectively).  
Comparison of the evolution of the variability of the mode of precipitation \acp{eof} (Figure~\ref{fig:pr mode variability}) shows no significant changes in modes 3,4 and 5 between the two scenarios evaluated. 
Those encode on median $5\%$, $6\%$, and $6.5\%$ with small fluctuations introduced by the members. 
Mode 2 also looks very similar in both scenarios, with a median encoded variability of around $8.5\%$. 
The primary \ac{eof} on the other shows significant differences between scenarios: While it has a far greater variability across members than the other modes and follows a general upward trend in both SSP126 and SSP585, it is more pronounced in the latter. 
It evolves from around $12.5\%$ in the 1850-1900 window to around $14\%$ in SSP126 and $15.5\%$ in SSP585.  


In general, the modes beyond the second seem to be not well separated from the others, which is why they will not be analyzed in detail in the following sections.

\end{figure}

This Section shows the evolution of the spatial \ac{eof} patterns, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:5modes each variable}. 
Since the \ac{eof} modes three, four, and five are generally quite low and similar in their eigenvalues (which directly correspond to the variance (see Equation~\ref{eq:eof variance calculation}) encoded shown in Figures~\ref{fig:ivt mode variability}, \ref{fig:psl mode variability}, and \ref{fig:pr mode variability}), they are left out of the analysis of this and the following sections, as modes' eigenvalues need to be well separated from each other \cite{hannachi_empirical_2007}. 
As already mentioned, mode three also seems to be not well separated, but is still shown in the following figures for an example how an inconsistent mode looks (at least for \ac{ivt} and precipitation), which makes it hard (or even pointless) to evaluate it for an ensemble simulation.  
Usually, the rule of thumb introduced by \citeauthorwork{north_sampling_1982} is used, but since the eigenvalues of the first three modes (or two for precipitation, see Figure~\ref{fig:pr mode variability}), this is left out of this thesis. 

The variability introduced through the 50 members of \ac{mpige6} is displayed here with the hexbin approach explained in Section~\ref{sec:vis_analysis}, while a discussion of the visualization of hexbin compared to classical spaghetti plots is given in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.
The images in this section are the spatial patterns of the first and last timescopes, which show the evolution of the different scenarios.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ivt eof evolution} shows the evolution of \ac{ivt} \ac{eof} spatial patterns. 
In general, regardless of the future scenario, EOF1 and EOF2 stays structurally very stable across all the ensembles' members, which can be seen on the clear, dark green borders of the colored surfaces. 
EOF3 on the other hand seems pretty unstable, since most of the map is covered in light greed hexagons, which means that the contour lines of zero switch significantly between all the 50 members of the ensemble. 
This also has consequences for the alignment across members and time, which will obviously not work if the patterns differ greatly across time and members. 
Therefor, the analysis regarding such patterns will be kept short since the multi-member, sliding window analysis of such patterns used in this Thesis does not apply very well to such patterns. 

The dominant EOF1 pattern of \ac{ivt} is characterized by a positive \ac{ivt} values reaching from Florida to Spain and negative values from the east coast of the USA to Northern Europe and the northern Atlantic. 
There are three clearly visible borders of these positive and negative areas, associated with three groups of contour lines: The first going through Canada, quite coherently across members (many dark green hexagons in a row), and then following the east coast of Greenland, fading out over the mainland quite differently across the members (many light green hexagons in a larger area). 
The second border follows a similar pattern: Starting quite coherent across members at the beginning of the Florida peninsula, over the Atlantic to the east coast of France, and then fading out differently in eastern Europe. 
The third border goes through the most southern part of the evaluated area, through North Africa and then to the Arabian Peninsula, staying pretty consistent across its path. 
Comparing the state of the patterns at the end of the different future scenario simulations, the change is quite subtle, but visible in the area of France and the south of the British Islands:
While the dark green hexagons in the beginning of the historical simulation are on/below the red line of the preindustrial simulation, the majority of zero contour lines in SSP126 seem to be above the preindustrial control contour line. 
In SSP585, the dark green hexagons stretch even further north, indicating that the slight northward shift of \ac{ivt} EOF1 at the end of the 21st century is even more pronounced. 

The \ac{ivt} EOF2 is characterized by a strong \ac{ivt} anomaly right were the separation contour line of EOF1 is, and lesser, opposite anomalies in the north and south. 
Comparing the beginning of the historical simulation with SSP126, the changes seem only minimal, whereas the difference of SSP585 and the others are far more pronounced: 
While the southern, prominent separation contour line seems to be more variable across members (broader hexbin band), the northern isoline appears to move to the east, opening the pattern up to the north. 
Also, the big area of fading out contour lines in the north of Scandinavia, seems to now be (more or less) uniformly part of the positive anomaly.  
% While the border in Greenland looks very similar at the end of SSP126 and the begin of the historical simulation, 
% On this example a way of interpreting the hexbin visualization is given, which can be applied to the patterns in Figures \ref{fig:pr eof evolution} and \ref{fig:psl eof evolution}. 
While mode three of \ac{ivt} \ac{eof} does expose changes between the different scenarios (again historical simulation and SSP126 look very similar, while SSP585 differs), the patterns seem to be pretty unstable compared to the other, indicated by the whole map being covered in light green hexbins. 
This implies that the contour lines of zero are all over the map, which means that the structures are quite different across the simulations' members.

\end{figure}

The evolution of sea level pressure patterns is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:psl eof evolution}, which shows the North Atlantic Oscillation and the East Atlantic Pattern (see Section~\ref{sec:nao}). 
While the first two \acp{eof} are well known, real world phenomena, the third mode was never mentioned in the related literature. 
Although it seems to be stable across members and time scopes, it will therefore be left out of the analysis. 
The \ac{nao} in mode one, characterized by its north-south dipole of pressure, is very consistent across the 50 members of the simulation, indicated by the narrow band of hexbins showing the switching line between the positive/negative anomalies. 
Comparing the historical simulation with SSP585, there seems to be a slight northward shift of the hexbin band, best visible at the northern part of the British Islands. 
This shift seems to be less pronounced in SSP126. 
The \ac{nao} does not exhibit outliers across all sliding windows. In contrast, the \ac{eap} appears deformed in some members, as evidenced by a few very lightly colored hexbins in the blue center of the historical part. These deformations are also observable in other scopes throughout the simulations, which are not related to the historical part of the timeline.
The southern border of the prominent negative pattern remains indistinguishable between the scenarios and the historical simulation. However, the stable northern border, marked by dark green hexbins, seems to shift further north, particularly in SSP585.




Similarly to the other figures in this Section, Figure~\ref{fig:pr eof evolution} shows the evolution of dominant precipitation \ac{eof} patterns. 
While mode 1 looks very similar to the primary pattern of \ac{ivt} \ac{eof}, the secondary mode looks quite comparable to the \ac{eap}. 
Quite noticeable in the primary pattern is the strong positive precipitation anomaly at the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula. 
Also, EOF1 is associated with negative anomalies along the southern east coast of Norway and a small positive pattern on the southern-western coast of Greenland. 
The SSP126 EOF1 pattern extends considerably into mainland Europe and also extends further north. 
This effect is noticeable only in Europe and not in the Atlantic, with the anomaly along the coast of the Iberian Peninsula becoming more pronounced (indicated by a more intense blue). 
In the SSP585 EOF1 pattern, the effects observed in SSP126 are even more pronounced, with the piControl line comparable to the farthest outliers of SSP585.
% - negative anomalies at the southern east coast of norway
% - SSP126 EOF1 pattern: extends into mainland europe quite a bit, also entends to the north. Effect only noticeable in Europe, not the Atlantic. Also the Anomaly on the coast of Iberian Peninsula got larger (more intense blue)
% - SSP585 EOF1 pattern: effects of SSP126 are more pronounced, piControl line is compareable to outliers of SSP585 
EOF2 of precipitation appears to be quite unstable across the members of the simulations, as indicated by hexbins filling most of the map. The only somewhat stable area is a positive anomaly over Great Britain and slightly further north. A small but consistent negative anomaly is observed along the east coast of Iceland in many members. However, this stability collapses in some members and time steps, as shown by very light green hexbins moving through the center. In future scenarios, the central positive pattern opens up to the north, resembling the evolution of the \ac{eap}. This effect is more pronounced in SSP585 than in SSP126.

% - EOF2 of precipitation seems also not very stable across the simulations' members (indicated by hexbins filling most of the map)
% - only area somewhat stable: positive anomaly over great britain and a bit more north. 
% - small but consistent in many members: small negative anomaly at the east coast of iceland 
% - but this also collapses in some members and timesteps, indicated by very light green hexbins moving through the center 
% - Effect in future scenarios: Central positive pattern opens up to the north, similar to the evolution of the \ac{eap} 
% - this is more pronounced in SSP585 then in SSP126


\subsection{Evolution of Temporal Patterns}

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/std_ivt_50seasons_tempmodescale_3modes.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption[IVT SD Evolution]{Evolution of the standard deviation of \ac{ivt} \ac{eof} coefficients for each scope and simulation member. Top plot shows results for SSP126, bottom plot for SSP585.}
  \label{fig:std ivt evolution}
\end{figure}

As explained in Section~\ref{sec:vis_analysis}, there is no proper way to visualize the \ac{eof} coefficients of an ensemble in the same way as in the related work. 
Therefore, the only way left is to analyze the statistics of those signals and compare them in a boxplot to get a sense of variability across members. 
In Figures~\ref{fig:std ivt evolution}, \ref{fig:std psl evolution}, and \ref{fig:std pr evolution} the evolution of the \ac{sd} of \ac{ivt}, sea level pressure, and precipitation is displayed, respectively. 
Keeping in mind that being scaled to the original unit means multiplying each \ac{eof} coefficient series with the associated singular value, which is very closely related to the encoded variance (see Equation~\ref{eq:eof variance calculation}). 


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/std_psl_50seasons_tempmodescale_3modes.png}
  \end{center}
  \caption[PSL SD Evolution]{Evolution of the standard deviation of \ac{psl} \ac{eof} coefficients for each scope and simulation member. Top plot shows results for SSP126, bottom plot for SSP585.}
  \label{fig:std psl evolution}
\end{figure}

Analyzing the evolution of the \ac{sd} of the \ac{ivt} \ac{eof} coefficients, that compared to the quasi-stationary preindustrial control simulation the \ac{sd} increases significantly, regardless of the scenario. 
While mode 1 experiences a drop in \ac{sd} in the scopes from $\approx$ 1933 to 1999 (start of the scope), the \ac{sd} of the members keep steadily increasing. 
This increase is much more pronounced in the SSP585 scenario than in SSP126, resulting in a median \ac{sd} of $\approx 970~kg~s^{-1} m^{-1}$ (compared to $\approx 820~kg~s^{-1}m^{-1}$ in SSP126). 
This change is much more extreme than the sole change in proportionate encoded variability shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ivt mode variability}. 
The variance across the members seems pretty similar in both scenarios. 
All of this applies to modes two and three as well: Slow but steady increase in \ac{sd}, which remains consistent in SSP126 but experiences a sharp increase in the later scopes of SSP585.  



\begin{figure}[htb]

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/std_pr_50seasons_tempmodescale_3modes.png}

  \caption[PR SD Evolution]{Evolution of the standard deviation of \ac{pr} \ac{eof} coefficients for each scope and simulation member. Top plot shows results for SSP126, bottom plot for SSP585.}
  \label{fig:std pr evolution}
\end{figure}

Regarding the evolution of SD of sea level pressure \ac{eof}, it is obvious that the levels are more consistent across all scopes, regardless of the scenario. 
Also, the piControl simulation is completely in line with the corresponding boxplots and could not be distinguished from the historical/scenario simulation. 
When comparing the scenarios, the SD of the Mode 1 coefficients (\ac{nao} indices) seem to be very similar to each other, with SSP585 having maybe a bit more variability across members. 
While it is also hard to distinguish the results of the different scenarios for Mode 3, \ac{sd} evolution of Mode 2 (\ac{eap} indices) seem to experience a more pronounced increase in the later scopes in SSP585 than in SSP126.  
This could be explained with the increase in proportional variability of that mode shown in Figure~\ref{fig:psl mode variability}.


The standard deviation of precipitation \ac{eof} coefficients appears to expose the largest differences compared to the piControl simulation and the scenarios. 
Similarly to the \ac{ivt} piControl \ac{eof} coefficients \ac{sd}, the precipitation piControl has a dump in \ac{eof} coefficient \ac{sd} in roughly the same timespan of scopes, which may be connected. 
The SSP126 scenario only shows a moderate increase in mode 1, and no significant change in other modes. 
On the other hand, SSP585 shows a significant increase in all modes, which is different from the encoded variability shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pr mode variability}, where only the first mode exposes a steep increase. 


\section{Relationships with other Variables}

This section explores the correlation relationships between the dominant \acp{eof} and other variables an their \acp{eof}. 

\subsection{Relationships of \acp{eof}}

The different \acp{eof} of the variables can easily be compared by measuring the relationship between their temporal \ac{eof} coefficients. 
Although cross-correlation was used to find correlation patterns shifted in time (as explained in Section~\ref{sec:vis_analysis}), the analysis revealed that all somewhat correlated patterns had the highest correlation with lag zero ($\equiv$ the same month). 
The few nonzero lag values are only a few outliers, which can be seen in the cross-correlation analysis example of  \ac{ivt} mode 1 and \ac{psl} mode 2 in Figure~\ref{fig:crosscorrelation example}.
Therefore, finding the maximal cross-correlation distorts the actual correlation, which is expected to occur in the same month. 
That is why this section only displays the correlation that has not shifted.
Following the argumentation in the previous section, only relationships between the first two modes of the variables were explored. 
In addition, only the figures with striking correlations (\acf{pcc} $> 0.4$) are evaluated. 
% Since the sample size is 200 ($50 \cdot 4$ months) for each scope, every result $> 0.5$ is significant at $p < 0.01$.

\end{figure}

The first relationships to explore are the ones between the indices of the dominant oscillations of the Atlantic and the \ac{ivt} modes. 
In general, it is expected that high values of \ac{ivt} are associated with low pressure areas.
Figure~\ref{fig:cor ivt psl modes11} shows the correlation of the \ac{nao} index with the activity of the primary \ac{ivt} mode. 
As expected, it shows a strong negative \ac{pcc} of about $-0.75$, with quite little variability across the different members. 
Comparing the different scenarios, it seems that SSP126 stays very similar to the historical simulation. 
SSP585, on the other hand, seems to be more variable across the members and slightly less correlated in the later years. The first could be the reason for the latter.

% \end{figure}
%

The relationships between mode 1 and mode 2 of \ac{ivt} and PSL and vice versa are pretty similar (Figure~\ref{fig:crosscorrelation example} shows one of them using cross-correlation): 
Both have the median \ac{pcc} around $0.5$, with the boxplots whiskers reaching around $0.25$. 
Also, both seem to experience a slight increase in median correlation in the late years of SSP585, while SSP126 stays pretty consistent.

% \end{figure}
%

Figure~\ref{fig:cor ivt psl modes22} shows the evolution of the correlation of the index of the \ac{eap} with the secondary \ac{ivt} mode. 
It shows a slightly weaker relationship than in Figure~\ref{fig:cor ivt psl modes11} with a median \ac{pcc} around $0.6$. 
Again, SSP126 remains similar to the historical simulation and the piControl simulation. 
But in SSP585, the correlation with the \ac{eap} index drops to a median of $0.5$, while the variability across members increases.

\end{figure}


In Figure~\ref{fig:cor pr ivt modes11} it is obvious that the primary modes of \ac{ivt} and precipitation are very closely related. 
It shows a \ac{pcc} of about $0.9$, with very little variance across the members. 
In addition, there is barely a difference between SSP126 and SSP585. 
The secondary modes of \ac{ivt} and precipitation look quite different:
Although Figure~\ref{fig:cor pr ivt modes22} shows a fairly high median \ac{pcc} of approximately $0.75$, there are a lot of outliers that reach a similar extent in the negative spectrum. 
Also, the pre-industrial control simulation shows this kind of behavior in the scopes beginning at 1949 to 1974 (with interruptions). 
The explanation for this is pretty simple: Since this mode is pretty unstable across different members (see previous section), the alignment to the pattern shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cor pr ivt modes22} did not work very well, which causes the pattern (and following this also the \ac{eof} coefficients) to flip, resulting in the value on the other side of the correlation spectrum.

\end{figure}

Since the correlation between \ac{ivt} and \ac{nao}/\ac{eap} and precipitation and \ac{ivt} are already known, the analysis of their temporal correlation does not yield surprises. 
However, Figures~\ref{fig:cor psl pr modes11} and \ref{fig:cor psl pr modes22} show their correlation evolution, showing the expected high negative ($\approx -0.75$) with the \ac{nao} index and the expected high positive correlation with the \ac{eap} index. 
Interestingly, the drop in correlation that was visible in Figure~\ref{fig:cor ivt psl modes22} does not appear in the relationship between precipitation and the \ac{eap}. 
But this could also be due to the amount of outliers (caused by incoherent, misaligned patterns of precipitation EOF2) that warp the results.

  \label{fig:ivt eof pr cor mode1}
\end{figure}

Although the relationships of different patterns are interesting, \acp{eof} are notoriously difficult to interpret \cite{hannachi_empirical_2007, dommenget_cautionary_2002}. 
For sea level pressure \acp{eof} this has been solved, since \ac{nao} and \ac{eap} (and their indices) are established physical modes and were first discovered using traditional measurements and evaluation of weather stations. 
It was then discovered that the \acp{eof} of said fields also expose the measured patterns and are therefore a useful model to represent these physical modes.  
This type of analysis does not yet exist for \ac{ivt} and precipitation in Europe. 
Since the causality is quite clear (pressure oscillations influence the wind and therefore \ac{ivt} and \ac{ivt} influences precipitation), these directions of \ac{eof} mode $\rightarrow$ data correlation are explored. 
The most interesting of such analyzes is the relationship between \ac{ivt} \ac{eof} modes and the precipitation data, since this could help explain what influence certain modes have on the precipitation in Europe. 
The correlations between sea level pressure \ac{eof} modes and \ac{ivt} data are explored as well.

Figure~\ref{fig:ivt eof pr cor mode1} shows the correlation maps of mode 1 of the beginning of the historical simulation, the end of the SSP126 scenario, and the end of SSP585. 
The isocontours indicate areas with \ac{pcc} values higher than $0.6$, therefore areas where the actual precipitation behaves quite similarly to the dominant \ac{ivt} pattern. 
This area is mainly the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula (area of highest correlation), the ocean westward of it, and for some members the Côte d'Azur. 
Looking at the evolution in time one can see that the area of high correlation do not change that much in SSP126. 
It seems to stretch a bit further north and more confident in the peak at the Côte d'Azur (darker green of hexbins in that area). 
Furthermore, the Atlantic coast of France appears to be associated with \ac{pcc} values $>0.6$ in some outliers of the ensemble. 
SSP585 shows the same changes, but far more pronounced: The outliers even reach the British Islands in the north, and the west coast of France seems to be part of the higher correlation area for most members, similar to the Côte d'Azur.
% But after all the contour of the piControl run (red), which changed only marginally, is still in the most likely (dark green) area.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ivt eof pr cor mode2} shows the same analysis, but for mode 2 of \ac{ivt} \ac{eof}. 
The area of higher (positive) correlations are here especially the west coasts of the British Islands and Scandinavia, but also the ocean westward of them, the whole west coast of Europe, and the North Sea. 
Also, there are only a few members indicating that correlation level in the Gulf of Bothnia (between Finland and Sweden), but these seem to be outliers. 
The end of the SSP126 scenario looks quite similar to the beginning of the historical simulation, except that the contour lines seem to reach less into the European mainland and are less confident on the west coast of France.  
This could be due to the increased influence of \ac{ivt} EOF1 in the same area, which reduces the effect of the secondary mode on that coast.

\end{figure}



Figure~\ref{fig:psl eof ivt cor mode1} shows the same correlation maps, but with the primary PSL \ac{eof} (the \ac{nao} index) and \ac{ivt} data. 
This has the goal of seeing how the oscillation indices are connected to the actual \ac{ivt} data, and maybe even tracking a northward shift there. 
Here, the correlations in the direction of Figures~\ref{fig:cor ivt psl modes11} and \ref{fig:cor ivt psl modes22}, so negative for EOF1 and positive for EOF2.  
% In the first mode the negative correlations below $-0.6$ are shown, which should display the areas associated with the inverse of the normal \ac{nao} (pressure low in the south and pressure high in the north). 
Notable is here the area of positive correlation, which fits the description of the mechanics of the \ac{nao} given in Section~\ref{sec:nao}. 
In general, the hexbins are not as dark green as in the previous figures, indicating that the members do not agree as unanimous. 
The highest correlation on that level is on the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco, and the ocean westward of that area. 
In the historical simulation, the Labrador Sea also features a few light green hexbins, indicating that only a few members seem to have that kind of correlation between \ac{ivt} and the \ac{nao} index. 
The changes between the beginning of the historical simulation and the ends of SSP126 and SSP585 are only marginal, no (northward or whatsoever) shift of the really important dark green hexbins. 
This means that only a few outliers of the members changed, and the contour lines of the largest quantity of members remain pretty much the same. 



Figure~\ref{fig:psl eof ivt cor mode2} depicts the changes in correlation between the PSL EOF2 coefficients (\ac{eap} index) and \ac{ivt} data. 
The positive correlation seems to affect all Europe, but especially the European West Coast in France and the Iberian Peninsula. 
But, similar to the \ac{nao} index, there are no structural changes visible between the historical simulation and both future scenarios, only some outliers, while the hexbins of darker green stay in place.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

This section discusses the results shown in the previous sections as well as the effectiveness of the introduced hexbin visualization. 

\subsection{Insights about the patterns}

The interpretation of applying more complex statistical/mathematical procedures (such as \acp{eof}) to physical data is not trivial and requires the expertise of a domain scientist.
While the benefits of analyzing \acp{eof} instead of the original data are great, they are notoriously hard to interpret with regard to the actual atmospheric physics behind them \cite{dommenget_cautionary_2002, hannachi_empirical_2007}.
The main reasons for this are the forced orthogonality of modes, which does not really exist in the real world \cite{hannachi_empirical_2007}, and the \enquote{hallucination} of modes, which means creating certain modes that do not have an equivalent in the real data/world (which was shown in detail in the work of \citeauthorwork{dommenget_cautionary_2002}). 
The reason for said hallucinations is also the forced orthogonality of \ac{eof} modes. 
It is a purely mathematical decomposition based on maximized variability which could be physically interpreted given enough physical indications, such as the \ac{nao} index calculated based on weather station data vs. the dominant \ac{psl} \ac{eof} coefficients.
The spatial patterns of \acp{eof} do \textit{not} areas of relative or absolute increase or decrease, but rather show maps of variability patterns which appear together in time.
Yet, the importance of the dominant modes of \ac{ivt} were mentioned and analyzed in previous work \cite{salstein_modes_1983, zou_interdecadal_2018}. 
It could be a great approach to the much needed dimension reduction for the huge amount of turbulent data, focusing only on the most prevalent parts of moisture transport and precipitation. 
In addition, the results still yield some interesting differences between the historical simulation and both evaluated future scenarios. 
The focus of this work was a) the generation of \ac{eof} patterns of moisture-related variables and b) the visualization of the variability across ensemble members. 
This section tries to summarize the most important discoveries related to European moisture \acp{eof}, their relationships, and their development in future scenarios. 

Starting with the analysis of variance encoded by different modes (Section~\ref{sec:results encoded variance}), the most interesting discoveries are the changing importance of modes in different future scenarios. 
Most importantly, here is the clearly visible increase in the \ac{sd} of PSL EOF2 (\ac{eap}) in SSP585 by $2-3 \%$ and EOF1 of precipitation data by a similar amount. 
This could be explained by the increase in the area covered by this mode in SSP585, shown in Section~\ref{sec:spatial pattern evolution}. 
By covering a larger area, this mode can cover a larger portion of the whole datasets' anomaly. 
In addition, this suggests that a larger area behaves more similarly in time ($\equiv$ can be represented with the same temporal patterns/\ac{eof} coefficients). 


One of the most interesting results of this analysis is the very strong relationship of the primary modes of \ac{ivt} and precipitation \acp{eof} with a correlation coefficient of about $0.9$.
This may indicate that EOF1 of \ac{ivt} is a driver of that particular precipitation mode, as water vapor transport causes precipitation (and not vice versa). 
The primary mode of PR appears to be especially important for precipitation in the east (coast) of the Iberian Peninsula, which would then also be true for the primary \ac{eof} of \ac{ivt}. 
This impression is also reinforced by looking at the correlation maps of \ac{ivt} EOF1 and precipitation data (Figure~\ref{fig:ivt eof pr cor mode1}), which shows very high correlation values with the temporal pattern of said mode on the east coast of the Iberian Peninsula. 
The pronounced northward expansion of both PR EOF1 and the correlation between \ac{ivt} EOF1 and precipitation could also be explained with the northward shift/expansion of the dominant \ac{ivt} mode, which means that this mode influences a larger region of Europe with more pronounced climate change. 

Also interesting is the change in the spatial component of the secondary \ac{ivt} \ac{eof}. 
Mainly because the consequences of that are not entirely clear. 
The correlation between \ac{ivt} EOF2 and precipitation show some changes in SSP585 (less influence on the west coast of Europe), but this could also be due to the increased influence of \ac{ivt} EOF1. 
Furthermore, the relationship with the \ac{eap} index (Figure~\ref{fig:cor ivt psl modes22}), appears to drop in the later years of the scenario, in contrast to SSP126. 

The analysis of the standard deviation of the different modes had the objective of showing the fluctuations and their evolution. 
Since the \ac{eof} coefficients have a SD of one in their normal (unscaled) state, they are entirely dependent on the scaling, encoded in the singular values of the respective mode. 
Most notably is here the striking difference between SSP126 and SSP585 in variance of the dominant \ac{ivt} \ac{eof} modes. 
Since this is not reflected in the percentage share of variance in these modes, the most likely answer is that the variance of \ac{ivt} increases in general more in SSP585.
A similar pattern can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:std pr evolution}, but this can be explained with a combination of an increase in total variance and an increase in the percentage share of PR EOF1. 
In the end it needs to be stressed that these are just speculations, and the actual interpretation needs to be performed by domain scientists. 

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item in general, real interpretation of the results require the knowledge of a domain expert
%   \item But: the analysis shows some changes during climate change, and some could be attributed to intensity thereof 
%   \item but still: some of the results can still be explained using the foundations of \acp{eof} 
%   \item the evolution of variability is interesting. Some modes seem to significantly increase their portion of variability, which could have to do with their expansion: More space covered with one mode -> more variability encoded 
%   \item the general expansion of the nodes could be due to the northward shift of the \ac{nao} (domain expert required)
%   \item but also: There seems to be a change in the East Atlantic pattern  
%   \item Common pattern: The primary modes of all three variables seem quite connected (no surprise since the \ac{nao} and \ac{eap} are known to be drivers of wind and precipitation in winterly Europe)
%   \item Also: the \ac{eap} seems connected with the secondary \ac{ivt} mode and the secondary pr mode. But careful here: They are also somewhat correlated to mode 1 (and vice versa) -> problem of orthogonality. Also mode 2 of precipitation seems pretty unstable and may be degenerated

    \label{fig:comparsion member vis}
\end{figure}

This section focuses on the discussion of the presented hexbin visualization of contour lines in ensemble simulations. 
The goal was to convey the likelihood of a contour line going through a bin in a more direct way, instead of relying on counting (which isn't even possible sometimes). 
Especially for large numbers of members/contour lines, the real quantity of contour lines passing through an area is quite hard to recognize. 
Looking at Figure~\ref{fig:comparsion member vis spaghetti}, it is quite difficult (even with zooming and counting) to intuitively determine how many contour lines are actually there on the coast of Norway/Sweden. 
It is easy to recognize very few contour lines, but it gets far harder to distinguish, e.g. between 10 or 25 lines. 
Although intuitively seeing the exact amount is also not possible using the current hexbin approach, it gives at least an idea about the percentage and can be compared to other regions (e.g., the density at the coast of Norway/Sweden is similar to the density near Ireland). 
In the authors' opinion, it is not really possible to compare in spaghetti plots. 
Given the fact that the trend of ensemble members tends to be more than less, spaghetti plots seem to be less capable of displaying an ensemble's variability. 




A weakness of the approach is the distortion introduced by the map projection, which results in the space between the bins in the far north of the map, which may result in confusion. 
A possible way of fixing this error could be to also distort the polygons at each position, similar to the Tissot's spheres shown in Section~\ref{sec:map projections}.
