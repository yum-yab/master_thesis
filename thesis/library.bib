It is shown that the poles of the sea level pressure (SLP) field variability associated with rainfall variability are shifted about 15° northward with respect to those used in standard definitions of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). It is suggested that the influence of NAO on rainfall dominantly arises from the associated advection of humidity from the Atlantic Ocean. Rainfall is also related to different aspects of baroclinic wave activity, the variability of the latter quantity in turn being largely dependent on the NAO.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA‐Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA‐Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3‐hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set‐up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re‐forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA‐Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global‐mean correlation with monthly‐mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low‐frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA‐Interim, MERRA‐2 and JRA‐55 reanalyses.},

	abstract = {Moisture transport over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean is an important process governing precipitation distribution and variability over western Europe. To assess its long-term variability, the vertically integrated horizontal water vapor transport (IVT) from a long-term climate simulation spanning the period 850–2100 CE was used. Results show a steady increase in moisture transport toward western Europe since the late-nineteenth century that is projected to expand during the twenty-ﬁrst century under the RCP8.5 scenario. The projected IVT for 2070–99 signiﬁcantly exceeds the range given by interannual–interdecadal variability of the last millennium. Changes in IVT are in line with signiﬁcant increases in tropospheric moisture content, driven by the concurrent rise in surface temperatures associated with the anthropogenic climate trend. On regional scales, recent and projected precipitation changes over the British Isles follow the global positive IVT trend, whereas a robust precipitation decrease over Iberia is identiﬁed in the twenty-ﬁrst century, particularly during autumn. This indicates a possible extension of stable and dry summer conditions and a decoupling between moisture availability and dynamical forcing. The investigation of circulation features reveals a mean poleward shift of moisture corridors and associated atmospheric rivers. In particular, in Iberia, a signiﬁcant increase in the frequency of dry weather types is observed, accompanied by a decrease in the frequency of wet types. An opposite response is observed over the British Isles. These changes imply a stronger meridional north–south dipole in terms of pressure and precipitation distributions, enhancing the transport toward central Europe rather than to Iberia.},

The ﬂuxes are divided into ﬁlamentary structures known as tropospheric rivers and what are termed here broad ﬁelds. The results show that the tropospheric rivers may carry essentially the total meridional transport observed in the extratropical atmosphere but may occupy only about 10\% of the total longitudinal length at a given latitude. The transient ﬂuxes in traditional studies do not catch the ﬁlamentary structures completely and may therefore underestimate the fraction of transport assigned to moving systems, as well as omitting the geographical concentration. The mean ﬂow and eddy ﬂuxes evaluated by the new algorithm are considered to be more physically realistic.},

Using ERA5 data from 1988 to 2020, the time series of moisture transport and the trend across the boundary of each continent, including Eurasia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctic, Australia, and Greenland, have been investigated. The inﬂow and outﬂow sections of the moisture have been identiﬁed for each continent. The trends of moisture convergence over Eurasia, Africa, North America, and Antarctic are all positive, with the values of 2.59 ± 3.12, 2.60 ± 3.17, 12.98 ± 2.28, and 0.32 ± 0.47 (in 106 kg/s/decade), respectively, but only the trend over North America is statistically signiﬁcant at a 0.1 signiﬁcance level. The moisture convergence trend of −0.59 ± 3.63 (in 106 kg/s/decade) over South America is negative but insigniﬁcant. The positive trend of 0.10 ± 0.35 (in 106 kg/s/decade) over Greenland is very weak. The precipitation, evaporation, and moisture convergence are well balanced at middle and low latitudes, but the combination of moisture convergence and evaporation is systematically lower than the precipitation over Antarctic and Greenland. Contributions of evaporation and moisture convergence (or transport) to the continental precipitation vary with the continent, but the moisture convergence dominates the precipitation variability over all continents, and the signiﬁcant correlation coefﬁcients between the anomaly time series of continental mean moisture convergence and precipitation are higher than 0.8 in all continents.},

Prominent seasonal differences are detected both in precipitation climatologies and in characteristics of precipitation variability. It is shown that over western Europe the summer precipitation climatology and its year‐to‐year variability (expressed by standard deviations) are lower than those of the winter precipitation. Major seasonal differences are found over central eastern Europe. In this region the summer precipitation climatology and magnitudes of its interannual variability exceed respective winter characteristics by a factor of 2–3.5. Similar relationships are found for the summer and winter magnitudes of intraseasonal fluctuations of precipitation. The first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes of both summer and winter seasonal mean precipitation over Europe are associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, they explain very different (42\% for winter and 25\% for summer) fractions of total precipitation variability and form principally different spatial patterns. Temporal behavior of the respective principal components is also essentially different. The first EOF mode of the winter magnitudes of intraseasonal precipitation fluctuations is also associated with the NAO. The second EOF mode of the winter precipitation is linked to the East Atlantic teleconnection pattern. However, the respective mode in the magnitudes of intraseasonal fluctuations was not detected. The second EOF mode of the summer precipitation is associated with the 500 hPa heights pattern, which is characterized by four anomaly centers. Two major centers of opposite polarity are located over western Europe and Scandinavia‐northeastern European Russia.},

	abstract = {The Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE) is the largest ensemble of a single comprehensive climate model currently available, with 100 members for the historical simulations (1850–2005) and four forcing scenarios. It is currently the only large ensemble available that includes scenario representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and a 1\% CO2 scenario. These advantages make MPI-GE a powerful tool. We present an overview of MPI-GE, its components, and detail the experiments completed. We demonstrate how to separate the forced response from internal variability in a large ensemble. This separation allows the quantification of both the forced signal under climate change and the internal variability to unprecedented precision. We then demonstrate multiple ways to evaluate MPI-GE and put observations in the context of a large ensemble, including a novel approach for comparing model internal variability with estimated observed variability. Finally, we present four novel analyses, which can only be completed using a large ensemble. First, we address whether temperature and precipitation have a pathway dependence using the forcing scenarios. Second, the forced signal of the highly noisy atmospheric circulation is computed, and different drivers are identified to be important for the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions. Third, we use the ensemble dimension to investigate the time dependency of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation variability changes under global warming. Last, sea level pressure is used as an example to demonstrate how MPI-GE can be utilized to estimate the ensemble size needed for a given scientific problem and provide insights for future ensemble projects.},

Climatological trajectories indicate that moisture in North China originates, respectively, from Eurasia (14.4\%), eastern China (10.2\%), the Bay of Bengal-South China Sea (33.8\%), the Indian Ocean (10.7\%), and the Paciﬁc (30.9\%). The spatiotemporal analysis of moisture trajectory based on extended empirical orthogonal function indicates that a decrease of precipitation in North China is caused mainly by a decrease of water vapor sources from the south, the Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal, and the South China Sea, which overwhelms an increase of water vapor sources from the North, mainly Eurasia, eastern China, and northern western North Paciﬁc Ocean. In particular, the signiﬁcant decrease of precipitation in the late 1970s (by 11.6\%) is mainly caused by a 10.6\% decrease of moisture from all sources. The Bay of Bengal, the South China Sea, and the Indian Ocean are dominant moisture source areas affecting the decadal-scale variation of precipitation in North China.},

These are compared with simulations from the HadGEM2-A climate model which applied observed sea surface temperature and realistic radiative forcings. Median extreme daily rainfall across the identified events and locations is larger for GPCP (32 mm day−1) than HadUKP and the simulations (∼25 mm day−1). The heaviest observed and simulated daily rainfall events are associated with increased specific humidity and horizontal transport of moisture (median 850 hPa specific humidity of ∼6 g kg−1 and vapour transport of ∼150 g kg− 1m s− 1 for both observed and simulated events). Extreme daily rainfall events are less common during spring and summer across much of the British Isles, but in the south east region, they contribute up to 60\% of the total number of distinct extreme daily rainfall events during these months. Compared to winter events, the summer events over south east Britain are associated with a greater magnitude and more southerly location of moisture maxima and less spatially extensive regions of enhanced moisture transport. This contrasting dependence of extreme daily rainfall on moisture characteristics implies a range of driving mechanisms that depend upon location and season. Higher spatial and temporal resolution data are required to explore these processes further, which is vital in assessing future projected changes in rainfall and associated flooding.},

Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes “long term” simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere–ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of “near term” simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These “decadal predictions” are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive. For researchers unfamiliar with climate models, the limitations of the models and experiment design are described.},

A moisture budget decomposition is used to identify the contribution of the anomalies in evaporation, the mean ﬂow, storm tracks and the role of moisture convergence and advection. Over the eastern North Atlantic, Europe, and the Mediterranean, precipitation anomalies are primarily driven by the mean ﬂow anomalies with, for a positive NAO, anomalous moist advection causing enhanced precipitation in the northern British Isles and Scandinavia and anomalous mean ﬂow moisture divergence causing drying over continental Europe and the Mediterranean region. Transient eddy moisture ﬂuxes work primarily to oppose the anomalies in precipitation minus evaporation generated by the mean ﬂow, but shifts in storm-track location and intensity help to explain regional details of the precipitation anomaly pattern. The extreme seasonal precipitation anomalies that occurred during the two winters with the most positive (1988/89) and negative (2009/10) NAO indices are also explained by NAO-associated mean ﬂow moisture convergence anomalies.},

For analysis of two-dimensional vector fields, such as surface winds or currents, use of the complex EOF method has become widespread. In the present paper, this method is compared with a real-vector EOF method that apparently has previously been unused for current or wind fields in oceanography or meteorology. It is shown that these two methods differ primarily with respect to the concept of optimal representation. Further, the real-vector analysis can easily be extended to three-dimensional vector fields, whereas the complex method cannot. To illustrate the differences between approaches, both methods are applied to Ocean Surface Current Radar data collected off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, in June and July 1993. For this dataset, while the complex analysis “converges” in fewer modes, the real analysis is better able to isolate flows with wide cross-shelf structures such as tides.},

	abstract = {Interannual variability of the winter atmospheric river (AR) activities over the Northern Hemisphere is investigated. The leading modes of AR variability over the North Paciﬁc and North Atlantic are ﬁrst identiﬁed and characterized. Over the Paciﬁc, the ﬁrst mode is characterized by a dipole structure with enhanced AR frequency along the AR peak region at about 308N and reduced AR frequency farther north. The second mode exhibits a tripole structure with a narrow band of positive AR anomalies at about 308N and sandwiched by negative anomalies. Over the Atlantic, the ﬁrst mode exhibits an equatorward shift of the ARs with positive anomalies and negative anomalies located on the equatorward and poleward side of the AR peak region at about 408N, respectively. The second mode is associated with the strengthening and eastward extension of the AR peak region, which is sandwiched by negative anomalies. A large ensemble of atmospheric global climate models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), which shows high skill in simulating these modes, is then used to quantify the roles of sea surface temperature (SST) forcing versus internal atmospheric variability in driving the formation of these modes. Results show that SST forcing explains about half of the variance for the Paciﬁc leading modes, while that number drops to about a quarter for the Atlantic leading modes, suggesting higher predictability for the Paciﬁc AR variability. An additional ensemble driven only by observed tropical SST is further utilized to demonstrate the more important role that tropical SST plays in controlling the Paciﬁc AR variability while both tropical and extratropical SST exert comparable inﬂuences on the Atlantic AR variability.},

The seasonal cycle in AR frequency over the North Atlantic exhibits a relatively small amplitude, being more pronounced toward the east and south of the oceanic basin, as it is increasingly related to the seasonal cycle in storm activity and the meridional displacement of the subtropical high. In the eastern North Atlantic, downwind of the North American continent, it shows a more complex behavior. The interannual variability of AR frequency is weak across the entire North Atlantic, and it does not present consistent long-term spatiotemporal patterns. For the southern IAM, AR occurrence is slightly enhanced by the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation during the previous days. Up to 80\% of the anomalous precipitation events (above the 95th percentile) in the IAM are associated with ARs; these values exceed 90\% in winter and decrease to 75\% in spring when convection not related to ARs becomes a significant precipitation mechanism. Moisture advection within ARs is thus a very important contributor to anomalous precipitation. Likewise, the strength of the associated storm systems and the characteristics of the ARs themselves are also very relevant factors. The percentage of total ARs linked to anomalous precipitation is relatively low, only reaching 20\% where topographic features are favorable.},

	abstract = {Abstract. An automated atmospheric river (AR) detection algorithm is used for the North Atlantic Ocean basin, allowing the identification of the major ARs affecting western European coasts between 1979 and 2012 over the winter half-year (October to March). The entire western coast of Europe was divided into five domains, namely the Iberian Peninsula (9.75° W, 36–43.75° N), France (4.5° W, 43.75–50° N), UK (4.5° W, 50–59° N), southern Scandinavia and the Netherlands (5.25° E, 50–59° N), and northern Scandinavia (5.25° E, 59–70° N). Following the identification of the main ARs that made landfall in western Europe, a Lagrangian analysis was then applied in order to identify the main areas where the moisture uptake was anomalous and contributed to the ARs reaching each domain. The Lagrangian data set used was obtained from the FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion) model global simulation from 1979 to 2012 and was forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis on a 1° latitude–longitude grid.  The results show that, in general, for all regions considered, the major climatological areas for the anomalous moisture uptake extend along the subtropical North Atlantic, from the Florida Peninsula (northward of 20° N) to each sink region, with the nearest coast to each sink region always appearing as a local maximum. In addition, during AR events the Atlantic subtropical source is reinforced and displaced, with a slight northward movement of the sources found when the sink region is positioned at higher latitudes. In conclusion, the results confirm not only the anomalous advection of moisture linked to ARs from subtropical ocean areas but also the existence of a tropical source, together with midlatitude anomaly sources at some locations closer to AR landfalls.},

Applying the algorithm to the different reanalyses in the vicinity of Great Britain during the winter half-years of 1980–2010 (31 years) demonstrates generally good agreement of AR occurrence between the products. The relationship between persistent AR occurrences and winter floods is demonstrated using winter peaks-over-threshold (POT) floods (with on average one flood peak per winter). In the nine study basins, the number of winter POT-1 floods associated with persistent ARs ranged from approximately 40 to 80\%. A Poisson regression model was used to describe the relationship between the number of ARs in the winter half-years and the large-scale climate variability. A significant negative dependence was found between AR totals and the Scandinavian Pattern (SCP), with a greater frequency of ARs associated with lower SCP values.},
