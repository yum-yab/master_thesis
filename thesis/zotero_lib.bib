It is shown that the poles of the sea level pressure (SLP) field variability associated with rainfall variability are shifted about 15° northward with respect to those used in standard definitions of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). It is suggested that the influence of NAO on rainfall dominantly arises from the associated advection of humidity from the Atlantic Ocean. Rainfall is also related to different aspects of baroclinic wave activity, the variability of the latter quantity in turn being largely dependent on the NAO.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA‐Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA‐Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3‐hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set‐up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re‐forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA‐Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global‐mean correlation with monthly‐mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low‐frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA‐Interim, MERRA‐2 and JRA‐55 reanalyses.},

	abstract = {Moisture transport over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean is an important process governing precipitation distribution and variability over western Europe. To assess its long-term variability, the vertically integrated horizontal water vapor transport (IVT) from a long-term climate simulation spanning the period 850–2100 CE was used. Results show a steady increase in moisture transport toward western Europe since the late-nineteenth century that is projected to expand during the twenty-ﬁrst century under the RCP8.5 scenario. The projected IVT for 2070–99 signiﬁcantly exceeds the range given by interannual–interdecadal variability of the last millennium. Changes in IVT are in line with signiﬁcant increases in tropospheric moisture content, driven by the concurrent rise in surface temperatures associated with the anthropogenic climate trend. On regional scales, recent and projected precipitation changes over the British Isles follow the global positive IVT trend, whereas a robust precipitation decrease over Iberia is identiﬁed in the twenty-ﬁrst century, particularly during autumn. This indicates a possible extension of stable and dry summer conditions and a decoupling between moisture availability and dynamical forcing. The investigation of circulation features reveals a mean poleward shift of moisture corridors and associated atmospheric rivers. In particular, in Iberia, a signiﬁcant increase in the frequency of dry weather types is observed, accompanied by a decrease in the frequency of wet types. An opposite response is observed over the British Isles. These changes imply a stronger meridional north–south dipole in terms of pressure and precipitation distributions, enhancing the transport toward central Europe rather than to Iberia.},

The ﬂuxes are divided into ﬁlamentary structures known as tropospheric rivers and what are termed here broad ﬁelds. The results show that the tropospheric rivers may carry essentially the total meridional transport observed in the extratropical atmosphere but may occupy only about 10\% of the total longitudinal length at a given latitude. The transient ﬂuxes in traditional studies do not catch the ﬁlamentary structures completely and may therefore underestimate the fraction of transport assigned to moving systems, as well as omitting the geographical concentration. The mean ﬂow and eddy ﬂuxes evaluated by the new algorithm are considered to be more physically realistic.},

Using ERA5 data from 1988 to 2020, the time series of moisture transport and the trend across the boundary of each continent, including Eurasia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctic, Australia, and Greenland, have been investigated. The inﬂow and outﬂow sections of the moisture have been identiﬁed for each continent. The trends of moisture convergence over Eurasia, Africa, North America, and Antarctic are all positive, with the values of 2.59 ± 3.12, 2.60 ± 3.17, 12.98 ± 2.28, and 0.32 ± 0.47 (in 106 kg/s/decade), respectively, but only the trend over North America is statistically signiﬁcant at a 0.1 signiﬁcance level. The moisture convergence trend of −0.59 ± 3.63 (in 106 kg/s/decade) over South America is negative but insigniﬁcant. The positive trend of 0.10 ± 0.35 (in 106 kg/s/decade) over Greenland is very weak. The precipitation, evaporation, and moisture convergence are well balanced at middle and low latitudes, but the combination of moisture convergence and evaporation is systematically lower than the precipitation over Antarctic and Greenland. Contributions of evaporation and moisture convergence (or transport) to the continental precipitation vary with the continent, but the moisture convergence dominates the precipitation variability over all continents, and the signiﬁcant correlation coefﬁcients between the anomaly time series of continental mean moisture convergence and precipitation are higher than 0.8 in all continents.},

Prominent seasonal differences are detected both in precipitation climatologies and in characteristics of precipitation variability. It is shown that over western Europe the summer precipitation climatology and its year‐to‐year variability (expressed by standard deviations) are lower than those of the winter precipitation. Major seasonal differences are found over central eastern Europe. In this region the summer precipitation climatology and magnitudes of its interannual variability exceed respective winter characteristics by a factor of 2–3.5. Similar relationships are found for the summer and winter magnitudes of intraseasonal fluctuations of precipitation. The first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes of both summer and winter seasonal mean precipitation over Europe are associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, they explain very different (42\% for winter and 25\% for summer) fractions of total precipitation variability and form principally different spatial patterns. Temporal behavior of the respective principal components is also essentially different. The first EOF mode of the winter magnitudes of intraseasonal precipitation fluctuations is also associated with the NAO. The second EOF mode of the winter precipitation is linked to the East Atlantic teleconnection pattern. However, the respective mode in the magnitudes of intraseasonal fluctuations was not detected. The second EOF mode of the summer precipitation is associated with the 500 hPa heights pattern, which is characterized by four anomaly centers. Two major centers of opposite polarity are located over western Europe and Scandinavia‐northeastern European Russia.},

It is currently the only large ensemble available that includes scenario representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and a 1\% CO2 scenario. These advantages make MPI-GE a powerful tool. We present an overview of MPI-GE, its components, and detail the experiments completed. We demonstrate how to separate the forced response from internal variability in a large ensemble. This separation allows the quantification of both the forced signal under climate change and the internal variability to unprecedented precision. We then demonstrate multiple ways to evaluate MPI-GE and put observations in the context of a large ensemble, including a novel approach for comparing model internal variability with estimated observed variability. Finally, we present four novel analyses, which can only be completed using a large ensemble. First, we address whether temperature and precipitation have a pathway dependence using the forcing scenarios. Second, the forced signal of the highly noisy atmospheric circulation is computed, and different drivers are identified to be important for the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions. Third, we use the ensemble dimension to investigate the time dependency of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation variability changes under global warming. Last, sea level pressure is used as an example to demonstrate how MPI-GE can be utilized to estimate the ensemble size needed for a given scientific problem and provide insights for future ensemble projects.},

Climatological trajectories indicate that moisture in North China originates, respectively, from Eurasia (14.4\%), eastern China (10.2\%), the Bay of Bengal-South China Sea (33.8\%), the Indian Ocean (10.7\%), and the Paciﬁc (30.9\%).

In particular, the signiﬁcant decrease of precipitation in the late 1970s (by 11.6\%) is mainly caused by a 10.6\% decrease of moisture from all sources. The Bay of Bengal, the South China Sea, and the Indian Ocean are dominant moisture source areas affecting the decadal-scale variation of precipitation in North China.},

A blended satellite/rain-gauge data set (GPCP-1DD) and regionally averaged daily rain-gauge observations (HadUKP) are combined with the ERA Interim reanalysis. These are compared with simulations from the HadGEM2-A climate model which applied observed sea surface temperature and realistic radiative forcings. Median extreme daily rainfall across the identified events and locations is larger for GPCP (32 mm day−1) than HadUKP and the simulations (∼25 mm day−1). The heaviest observed and simulated daily rainfall events are associated with increased specific humidity and horizontal transport of moisture (median 850 hPa specific humidity of ∼6 g kg−1 and vapour transport of ∼150 g kg− 1m s− 1 for both observed and simulated events). Extreme daily rainfall events are less common during spring and summer across much of the British Isles, but in the south east region, they contribute up to 60\% of the total number of distinct extreme daily rainfall events during these months. Compared to winter events, the summer events over south east Britain are associated with a greater magnitude and more southerly location of moisture maxima and less spatially extensive regions of enhanced moisture transport. This contrasting dependence of extreme daily rainfall on moisture characteristics implies a range of driving mechanisms that depend upon location and season. Higher spatial and temporal resolution data are required to explore these processes further, which is vital in assessing future projected changes in rainfall and associated flooding.},

Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes “long term” simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere–ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of “near term” simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These “decadal predictions” are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive. For researchers unfamiliar with climate models, the limitations of the models and experiment design are described.},

A moisture budget decomposition is used to identify the contribution of the anomalies in evaporation, the mean ﬂow, storm tracks and the role of moisture convergence and advection. Over the eastern North Atlantic, Europe, and the Mediterranean, precipitation anomalies are primarily driven by the mean ﬂow anomalies with, for a positive NAO, anomalous moist advection causing enhanced precipitation in the northern British Isles and Scandinavia and anomalous mean ﬂow moisture divergence causing drying over continental Europe and the Mediterranean region. Transient eddy moisture ﬂuxes work primarily to oppose the anomalies in precipitation minus evaporation generated by the mean ﬂow, but shifts in storm-track location and intensity help to explain regional details of the precipitation anomaly pattern. The extreme seasonal precipitation anomalies that occurred during the two winters with the most positive (1988/89) and negative (2009/10) NAO indices are also explained by NAO-associated mean ﬂow moisture convergence anomalies.},

For analysis of two-dimensional vector fields, such as surface winds or currents, use of the complex EOF method has become widespread. In the present paper, this method is compared with a real-vector EOF method that apparently has previously been unused for current or wind fields in oceanography or meteorology. It is shown that these two methods differ primarily with respect to the concept of optimal representation. Further, the real-vector analysis can easily be extended to three-dimensional vector fields, whereas the complex method cannot. To illustrate the differences between approaches, both methods are applied to Ocean Surface Current Radar data collected off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, in June and July 1993. For this dataset, while the complex analysis “converges” in fewer modes, the real analysis is better able to isolate flows with wide cross-shelf structures such as tides.},

	abstract = {Interannual variability of the winter atmospheric river (AR) activities over the Northern Hemisphere is investigated. The leading modes of AR variability over the North Paciﬁc and North Atlantic are ﬁrst identiﬁed and characterized. Over the Paciﬁc, the ﬁrst mode is characterized by a dipole structure with enhanced AR frequency along the AR peak region at about 308N and reduced AR frequency farther north. The second mode exhibits a tripole structure with a narrow band of positive AR anomalies at about 308N and sandwiched by negative anomalies. Over the Atlantic, the ﬁrst mode exhibits an equatorward shift of the ARs with positive anomalies and negative anomalies located on the equatorward and poleward side of the AR peak region at about 408N, respectively. The second mode is associated with the strengthening and eastward extension of the AR peak region, which is sandwiched by negative anomalies. A large ensemble of atmospheric global climate models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), which shows high skill in simulating these modes, is then used to quantify the roles of sea surface temperature (SST) forcing versus internal atmospheric variability in driving the formation of these modes. Results show that SST forcing explains about half of the variance for the Paciﬁc leading modes, while that number drops to about a quarter for the Atlantic leading modes, suggesting higher predictability for the Paciﬁc AR variability. An additional ensemble driven only by observed tropical SST is further utilized to demonstrate the more important role that tropical SST plays in controlling the Paciﬁc AR variability while both tropical and extratropical SST exert comparable inﬂuences on the Atlantic AR variability.},

The seasonal cycle in AR frequency over the North Atlantic exhibits a relatively small amplitude, being more pronounced toward the east and south of the oceanic basin, as it is increasingly related to the seasonal cycle in storm activity and the meridional displacement of the subtropical high. In the eastern North Atlantic, downwind of the North American continent, it shows a more complex behavior. The interannual variability of AR frequency is weak across the entire North Atlantic, and it does not present consistent long-term spatiotemporal patterns. For the southern IAM, AR occurrence is slightly enhanced by the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation during the previous days. Up to 80\% of the anomalous precipitation events (above the 95th percentile) in the IAM are associated with ARs; these values exceed 90\% in winter and decrease to 75\% in spring when convection not related to ARs becomes a significant precipitation mechanism. Moisture advection within ARs is thus a very important contributor to anomalous precipitation. Likewise, the strength of the associated storm systems and the characteristics of the ARs themselves are also very relevant factors. The percentage of total ARs linked to anomalous precipitation is relatively low, only reaching 20\% where topographic features are favorable.},

	abstract = {Abstract. An automated atmospheric river (AR) detection algorithm is used for the North Atlantic Ocean basin, allowing the identification of the major ARs affecting western European coasts between 1979 and 2012 over the winter half-year (October to March). The entire western coast of Europe was divided into five domains, namely the Iberian Peninsula (9.75° W, 36–43.75° N), France (4.5° W, 43.75–50° N), UK (4.5° W, 50–59° N), southern Scandinavia and the Netherlands (5.25° E, 50–59° N), and northern Scandinavia (5.25° E, 59–70° N). Following the identification of the main ARs that made landfall in western Europe, a Lagrangian analysis was then applied in order to identify the main areas where the moisture uptake was anomalous and contributed to the ARs reaching each domain. The Lagrangian data set used was obtained from the FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion) model global simulation from 1979 to 2012 and was forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis on a 1° latitude–longitude grid.  The results show that, in general, for all regions considered, the major climatological areas for the anomalous moisture uptake extend along the subtropical North Atlantic, from the Florida Peninsula (northward of 20° N) to each sink region, with the nearest coast to each sink region always appearing as a local maximum. In addition, during AR events the Atlantic subtropical source is reinforced and displaced, with a slight northward movement of the sources found when the sink region is positioned at higher latitudes. In conclusion, the results confirm not only the anomalous advection of moisture linked to ARs from subtropical ocean areas but also the existence of a tropical source, together with midlatitude anomaly sources at some locations closer to AR landfalls.},

Applying the algorithm to the different reanalyses in the vicinity of Great Britain during the winter half-years of 1980–2010 (31 years) demonstrates generally good agreement of AR occurrence between the products. The relationship between persistent AR occurrences and winter floods is demonstrated using winter peaks-over-threshold (POT) floods (with on average one flood peak per winter). In the nine study basins, the number of winter POT-1 floods associated with persistent ARs ranged from approximately 40 to 80\%. A Poisson regression model was used to describe the relationship between the number of ARs in the winter half-years and the large-scale climate variability. A significant negative dependence was found between AR totals and the Scandinavian Pattern (SCP), with a greater frequency of ARs associated with lower SCP values.},

            We explore the extent to which internal variability can reconcile discrepancies between observed and simulated warming in the upper tropical troposphere. We compare all extant radiosonde‐based estimates for the period 1958–2014 to simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 multimodel ensemble and the 100 realization Max Planck Institute large ensemble. We consider annual mean temperatures and all available 30‐and 15‐year trends. Most observed trends fall within the ensemble spread for most of the record, and trends calculated over 15‐year periods show better agreement than 30‐year trends, with generally larger discrepancies for the older observational products. The simulated amplification of surface warming aloft in the troposphere is consistent with observations, and the linear correlation between surface and simultaneous tropospheric warming trends decreases with trend length. We conclude that trend differences between observations and simulations of tropical tropospheric temperatures are dominated by observational uncertainty and chaotic internal variability rather than by systematic errors in model performance.

	abstract = {ECHAM6, the sixth generation of the atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM, is described. Major changes with respect to its predecessor affect the representation of shortwave radiative transfer, the height of the model top. Minor changes have been made to model tuning and convective triggering. Several model configurations, differing in horizontal and vertical resolution, are compared. As horizontal resolution is increased beyond T63, the simulated climate improves but changes are incremental; major biases appear to be limited by the parameterization of small‐scale physical processes, such as clouds and convection. Higher vertical resolution in the middle atmosphere leads to a systematic reduction in temperature biases in the upper troposphere, and a better representation of the middle atmosphere and its modes of variability. ECHAM6 represents the present climate as well as, or better than, its predecessor. The most marked improvements are evident in the circulation of the extratropics. ECHAM6 continues to have a good representation of tropical variability. A number of biases, however, remain. These include a poor representation of low‐level clouds, systematic shifts in major precipitation features, biases in the partitioning of precipitation between land and sea (particularly in the tropics), and midlatitude jets that appear to be insufficiently poleward. The response of ECHAM6 to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is similar to that of ECHAM5. The equilibrium climate sensitivity of the mixed‐resolution (T63L95) configuration is between 2.9 and 3.4 K and is somewhat larger for the 47 level model. Cloud feedbacks and adjustments contribute positively to warming from increasing greenhouse gases.

              Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play vital roles in the western United States and related regions globally, not only producing heavy precipitation and flooding, but also providing beneficial water supply. This paper introduces a scale for the intensity and impacts of ARs. Its utility may be greatest where ARs are the most impactful storm type and hurricanes, nor’easters, and tornadoes are nearly nonexistent. Two parameters dominate the hydrologic outcomes and impacts of ARs: vertically integrated water vapor transport (IVT) and AR duration [i.e., the duration of at least minimal AR conditions (IVT ≥ 250 kg m
              –1
              s
              –1
              )]. The scale uses an observed or predicted time series of IVT at a given geographic location and is based on the maximum IVT and AR duration at that point during an AR event. AR categories 1–5 are defined by thresholds for maximum IVT (3-h average) of 250, 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 kg m
              –1
              s

              –1
              continuously for 24–48 h. If the AR event duration is less than 24 h, it is downgraded by one category. If it is longer than 48 h, it is upgraded one category. The scale recognizes that weak ARs are often mostly beneficial because they can enhance water supply and snowpack, while stronger ARs can become mostly hazardous, for example, if they strike an area with antecedent conditions that enhance vulnerability, such as burn scars or wet conditions. Extended durations can enhance impacts. Short durations can mitigate impacts.},

This uncertainty is often neglected in the subsequent visualization, due to the fact that no established methods or available software exist. We describe a visualization method to render scalar ﬁelds with a probability density function at each data point. We render these data as isosurfaces and make use of a colour scheme, which intuitively gives the viewer an idea of which parts of the surface are more reliable than others. We further show how to extract an envelope that indicates within which volume the isosurface will lie with a certain conﬁdence, and augment the isosurfaces with additional geometry in order to show this information. The resulting visualization is easy and intuitive to understand and is suitable for rendering multiple distinguishable isosurfaces at a time. It can moreover be easily used together with other visualized objects, such as the geological context. Finally we show how we have integrated this into a visualization pipeline that is based on the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) and the open source scenegraph OpenSG, allowing us to render the results on a desktop and in different kinds of virtual environments. \& 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

            Trajectory analysis using a weather prediction model is performed for five cases to interpret the formation of enhanced bands of vertically integrated water vapor (IWV) in the central and eastern Pacific that are frequently seen in satellite images from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager. The connection of these enhanced bands with poleward water vapor transport from the Tropics is also examined. It is shown that the leading end of the enhanced IWV bands (defined as the most eastward and poleward end) is the manifestation of moisture convergence in the warm conveyor belt associated with extratropical cyclones, while the bands away from the leading end result mainly from moisture convergence along the trailing cold fronts. There is evidence that some enhanced IWV bands may be associated with a direct poleward transport of tropical moisture along the IWV bands from the Tropics all the way to the extratropics. The trajectory analysis, together with the seasonal mean sea level pressure analysis, indicates that a favorable condition for the occurrence of a direct, along-IWV band transport of tropical (defined as south of 23.5°N) moisture to the U.S. West Coast in the eastern Pacific is a weakened subtropical ridge in the central Pacific with an enhanced southwesterly low-level flow. The authors hypothesize that the direct poleward transport of tropical moisture within an enhanced IWV band in the eastern Pacific is most possible in the neutral El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase and is least possible in the El Niño phase.},

The relation between δ 18O in precipitation in the south of the Tibetan Plateau and moisture trajectories was discussed. The results show that the extremely low δ 18O in precipitation in the south of the Tibetan Plateau is always related to the moisture from the low-level sea surface evaporation. The long-distance transport of moisture also contributes to low δ 18O in precipitation probably due to the rainout process during moisture transport. It is also found that low δ 18O in precipitation is also related with deep layer transport of moisture, and with intensive condensation in the upper layers of the atmosphere, resulting in low δ 18O because of depletion of heavy isotopes in deep condensation. However, high δ 18O in precipitation whether in monsoon period or not is always companied with moisture coming from the upper layers, and the moisture is from northern or western sides of the plateau. The interpretation of the modeled results is in agreement with the isotope fractionation processes.},

Multi-charts are an extension of conventional bar and line charts: They linearize the 3D data points along a space-ﬁlling curve and draw them as multiple charts in the same plot area. The bar charts encode statistical information on ensemble members, such as histograms and probability densities, and line charts are overlayed to allow comparing members against the ensemble. Alternative linearizations based on histogram similarities or ensemble variation allow clustering of spatial locations depending on data distribution. Multi-charts organize the data at multiple scales to quickly provide overviews and enable users to select regions exhibiting interesting behavior interactively. They are further put into a spatial context by allowing the user to brush or query value intervals and speciﬁc distributions, and to simultaneously visualize the corresponding spatial points via volume rendering. By providing a picking mechanism in 3D and instantly highlighting the corresponding data points in the chart, the user can go back and forth between the abstract and the 3D view to focus the analysis.},

A simple and efficient programming language could accelerate applications of machine learning in various fields. Currently, the programming languages most commonly used to develop machine learning algorithms include Python, MATLAB, and C/C ++.

The Julia language is a fast, easy-to-use, and open-source programming language that was originally designed for high-performance computing, which can well balance the efficiency and simplicity. This paper summarizes the related research work and developments in the applications of the Julia language in machine learning. It first surveys the popular machine learning algorithms that are developed in the Julia language. Then, it investigates applications of the machine learning algorithms implemented with the Julia language. Finally, it discusses the open issues and the potential future directions that arise in the use of the Julia language in machine learning.},

However, evaluating the impact of an uncertainty visualization is complex due to the difﬁculties that people have interpreting uncertainty and the challenge of deﬁning correct behavior with uncertainty information. Currently, evaluators of uncertainty visualization must rely on general purpose visualization evaluation frameworks which can be ill-equipped to provide guidance with the unique difﬁculties of assessing judgments under uncertainty. To help evaluators navigate these complexities, we present a taxonomy for characterizing decisions made in designing an evaluation of an uncertainty visualization. Our taxonomy differentiates six levels of decisions that comprise an uncertainty visualization evaluation: the behavioral targets of the study, expected effects from an uncertainty visualization, evaluation goals, measures, elicitation techniques, and analysis approaches. Applying our taxonomy to 86 user studies of uncertainty visualizations, we ﬁnd that existing evaluation practice, particularly in visualization research, focuses on Performance and Satisfaction-based measures that assume more predictable and statistically-driven judgment behavior than is suggested by research on human judgment and decision making. We reﬂect on common themes in evaluation practice concerning the interpretation and semantics of uncertainty, the use of conﬁdence reporting, and a bias toward evaluating performance as accuracy rather than decision quality. We conclude with a concrete set of recommendations for evaluators designed to reduce the mismatch between the conceptualization of uncertainty in visualization versus other ﬁelds.},

The amount of information available to us is growing exponentially, owing to never-ending technological advancements. Data visualization is one of the ways to convey that information eﬀectively.

Data scientists know that missing out on uncertainty in data visualization can lead to misleading conclusions about data accuracy. In most cases, visualization approaches assume that the information represented is free from any error or unreliability; however, this is rarely true.

This survey discusses state-of-the-art approaches to uncertainty visualization, along with the concept of uncertainty and its sources.

            The pre-cold-frontal low-level jet within oceanic extratropical cyclones represents the lower-tropospheric component of a deeper corridor of concentrated water vapor transport in the cyclone warm sector. These corridors are referred to as atmospheric rivers (ARs) because they are narrow relative to their length scale and are responsible for most of the poleward water vapor transport at midlatitudes. This paper investigates landfalling ARs along adjacent north- and south-coast regions of western North America. Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) satellite observations of long, narrow plumes of enhanced integrated water vapor (IWV) were used to detect ARs just offshore over the eastern Pacific from 1997 to 2005. The north coast experienced 301 AR days, while the south coast had only 115. Most ARs occurred during the warm season in the north and cool season in the south, despite the fact that the cool season is climatologically wettest for both regions. Composite SSM/I IWV analyses showed landfalling wintertime ARs extending northeastward from the tropical eastern Pacific, whereas the summertime composites were zonally oriented and, thus, did not originate from this region of the tropics. Companion SSM/I composites of daily rainfall showed significant orographic enhancement during the landfall of winter (but not summer) ARs.
            The NCEP–NCAR global reanalysis dataset and regional precipitation networks were used to assess composite synoptic characteristics and overland impacts of landfalling ARs. The ARs possess strong vertically integrated horizontal water vapor fluxes that, on average, impinge on the West Coast in the pre-cold-frontal environment in winter and post-cold-frontal environment in summer. Even though the IWV in the ARs is greater in summer, the vapor flux is stronger in winter due to much stronger flows associated with more intense storms. The landfall of ARs in winter and north-coast summer coincides with anomalous warmth, a trough offshore, and ridging over the Intermountain West, whereas the south-coast summer ARs coincide with relatively cold conditions and a near-coast trough. ARs have a much more profound impact on near-coast precipitation in winter than summer, because the terrain-normal vapor flux is stronger and the air more nearly saturated in winter. During winter, ARs produce roughly twice as much precipitation as all storms. In addition, wintertime ARs with the largest SSM/I IWV are tied to more intense storms with stronger flows and vapor fluxes, and more precipitation. ARs generally increase snow water equivalent (SWE) in autumn/winter and decrease SWE in spring. On average, wintertime SWE exhibits normal gains during north-coast AR storms and above-normal gains during the south-coast AR storms. The north-coast sites are mostly lower in altitude, where warmer-than-normal conditions more frequently yield rain. During those events when heavy rain from a warm AR storm falls on a preexisting snowpack, flooding is more likely to occur.},

            Computational aspects of methods used to simulate the transport of water vapour in a global atmospheric general circulation model are examined. A set of properties useful in characterizing numerical methods for modelling atmospheric transport are identified. Spectral and semi‐Lagrangian methods, which are very different in terms of these desired properties are compared.
            
              The extent to which the schemes do not satisfy certain properties of the continuous equations provides a measure of one component of the error of the solution. For the spectral scheme, negative specific humidities
              q
              indicate such an error component. Conventional semi‐Lagrangian schemes are also susceptible to generating negative values. In addition, they are not inherently conservative. Shape‐preserving semi‐Lagrangian methods do not generate negative values, but still are non‐conservative. the degree to which the advection process does not conserve mass provides a measure of another error associated with the numerical solution. the negative error is shown to be large for the spectral transport scheme, measured either locally or globally. Measured globally, the semi‐Lagrangian transport schemes' conservation errors are equally large. Locally, the correction of this error can be made very much smaller, relative to physical processes in the model.
            
            The study highlights the computational problems which still exist within the better numerical methods used to simulate the transport of water vapour, and demonstrates the care with which one must apply computational constraints to the solution. the spectral and semi‐Lagrangian transport schemes produce very different climatologies in model simulations.

            The transport and accumulation of moisture played an essential role in the extremely heavy rainfall of July 2020 in Japan. To better understand this event in terms of moisture sources and transport routes, backward particle trajectory analysis was conducted. We found two major moisture sources: transport from the tropics and uptake from the subtropics. A narrow moisture channel was found along the edge of the western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), transporting the moisture to the Baiu front. However, most moisture from the tropics was lost due to precipitation, and their contributions were reduced to about 15\%. In contrast, the subtropical regions contributed over 80\% moisture via evaporation and lower tropospheric convection. Among those regions, the western Pacific contributed the most ({\textgreater}33\%). This study highlights the role of WPSH in moisture transport and demonstrated the importance of moisture uptake during transport.

            Plain Language Summary
            Heavy rainfalls hit Japan in July 2020, and the related atmospheric river was found to be accumulated by the moisture from tropics and subtropics. The moisture was transported by a narrow moisture channel along the edge of western Pacific Subtropical High. But, due to the precipitation during the transport, the moisture from the tropics decreased. On the other hand, when the air flows passed over the subtropical regions, they were moistened by evaporation and lower troposphere convection. Thus, our results suggest that the moisture from subtropical regions contributed the most to the moisture accumulation during the heavy rain event.

Understanding links between climate variability and landfalling ARs is critical for improving forecasts on timescales needed for water resource management. We examined 69 years of landfalling ARs along western North America using reanalysis and a long-term AR catalog to identify circulation drivers of AR landfalls. This analysis reveals that AR activity along the West Coast is largely associated with a handful of influential modes of atmospheric variability. Interaction between these modes creates favorable or unfavorable atmospheric states for landfalling ARs at different locations, effectively steering moisture plumes up and down the coast from Mexico to British Columbia. Seasonal persistence of certain modes helps explain interannual variability of landfalling ARs, including recent California drought years and the wet winter of 2016/2017.},

When the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) is strong and shifts southward and westward, the Indian Monsoon Low Pressure (IMLP) is weak, and the northern part of China stands behind the middle and high latitude trough, a large amount of water vapor from the Bay of Bengal (BOB), the South China Sea (SCS) and the western Pacific forms a strong and steady southwest WVT band and meets the strong cold water vapor from northern China in the YRB, thus it is likely to cause flood in the YRB. When WPSH is weak and shifts northward and eastward, IMLP is strong, and there is nearly straight west wind over the middle and high latitude, it is unfavorable for oceanic vapor extending to China and no steady and strong southwest WVT exists in the region south of the YRB. Meanwhile, the cold air from northern China is weak and can hardly be transported to the YRB. This brings on no obvious water vapor convergence, and then less precipitation in the YRB.},

            Trajectory analysis using a weather prediction model is performed for five cases to interpret the formation of enhanced bands of vertically integrated water vapor (IWV) in the central and eastern Pacific that are frequently seen in satellite images from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager. The connection of these enhanced bands with poleward water vapor transport from the Tropics is also examined. It is shown that the leading end of the enhanced IWV bands (defined as the most eastward and poleward end) is the manifestation of moisture convergence in the warm conveyor belt associated with extratropical cyclones, while the bands away from the leading end result mainly from moisture convergence along the trailing cold fronts. There is evidence that some enhanced IWV bands may be associated with a direct poleward transport of tropical moisture along the IWV bands from the Tropics all the way to the extratropics. The trajectory analysis, together with the seasonal mean sea level pressure analysis, indicates that a favorable condition for the occurrence of a direct, along-IWV band transport of tropical (defined as south of 23.5°N) moisture to the U.S. West Coast in the eastern Pacific is a weakened subtropical ridge in the central Pacific with an enhanced southwesterly low-level flow. The authors hypothesize that the direct poleward transport of tropical moisture within an enhanced IWV band in the eastern Pacific is most possible in the neutral El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase and is least possible in the El Niño phase.},

	abstract = {Single-model initial-condition large ensembles are powerful tools to quantify the forced response, internal climate variability, and their evolution under global warming. Here, we present the CMIP6 version of the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE CMIP6) with 30 realisations for the historical period and ﬁve emission scenarios. The power of MPI-GE CMIP6 goes beyond its predecessor ensemble MPI-GE by providing high-frequency output, the full range of emission scenarios including the highly policy-relevant low emission scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, and the opportunity to compare the ensemble to complementary high-resolution simulations. First, we describe MPI-GE CMIP6, evaluate it with observations and reanalyses and compare it to MPI-GE. Then, we demonstrate with six novel application examples how to use the power of the ensemble to better quantify and understand present and future climate extremes, to inform about uncertainty in approaching Paris Agreement global warming limits, and to combine large ensembles and artiﬁcial intelligence. For instance, MPI-GE CMIP6 allows us to show that the recently observed Siberian and Paciﬁc North American heatwaves would only avoid reaching 1-2 year return periods in 2071-2100 with low emission scenarios, that recently observed European precipitation extremes are captured only by complementary high-resolution simulations, and that 3-hourly output projects a decreasing activity of storms in midlatitude oceans. Further, the ensemble is ideal for estimates of probabilities of crossing global warming limits and the irreducible uncertainty introduced by internal variability, and is suﬃciently large to be used for inﬁlling surface temperature observations with artiﬁcial intelligence.},

At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 °C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings.

            The results of the sixth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP) are currently being analyzed and will form the basis of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. Since its creation in the mid‐1990s, CMIP has had an increasing influence on climate research. While the principle behind it has always remained the same—comparing different climate models under similar conditions—its design and motivations have evolved significantly over the phases of the project. This evolution is closely linked to that of the IPCC since, historically as well as today, the results of CMIP have played a major role in the Panel's reports. This role increased the visibility of CMIP. Over time, more and more people started to be interested in CMIP and to analyze its results. Despite this success, the way CMIP is used today raises methodological issues. In fact, CMIP has promoted a particular way of doing climate research, centered on a single tool–Global Coupled Models (GCMs)–and creating a gap between model developers and model users. Due to the debates regarding the interpretation of multi‐model ensembles and the validation of GCMs, whether the emphasis on this particular way of studying climate is serving the progress of climate science is questionable.

              We study the spatio-temporal variability of Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) and associated integrated water vapor and atmospheric parameters over the Euro-Atlantic region using long-term reanalysis datasets. Winds, temperature, and specific humidity at different pressure levels during 1979–2018 are used to study the water vapor transport integrated between 1000 and 300 hPa (IVT300) in mapping ARs. The intensity of ARs in the North Atlantic has been increasing in recent times (2009–2018) with large decadal variability and poleward shift ({\textasciitilde} 5° towards the North) in landfall during 1999–2018. Though different reanalysis datasets show similar spatial patterns of IVT300 in mapping ARs, bias in specific humidity and wind components led to IVT300 mean bias of 50 kg m
              −1
               s
              −1
              in different reanalysis products compared to ERA5. The magnitude of winds and specific humidity in the lower atmosphere (below 750 hPa) dominates the total column water vapor and intensity of ARs in the North Atlantic. Reanalysis datasets in the central North Atlantic show an IVT300 standard deviation of 200 kg m
              −1
               s
              −1
              which is around 33\% of the ARs climatology ({\textasciitilde} 600 kg m

               s
              −1
              ). Though ARs have a higher frequency of landfalling over Western Europe in winter half-year, the intensity of IVT300 in winter ARs is 3\% lower than the annual mean. The lower frequency of ARs in the summer half-year shows 3\% higher IVT300 than the annual mean. While ARs in the North Atlantic show a strong decadal change in frequency and path, the impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Scandinavian blocking on the location of landfall of ARs are significant. Furthermore, there is a strong latitudinal dependence of the source of moisture flux in the open ocean, contributing to the formation and strengthening ARs.},

SMILEs allow scientists to quantify and separate the internal variability of the climate system and its response to external forcing, with different types of SMILEs appropriate to answer different scientiﬁc questions. In this editorial we ﬁrst provide an introduction to SMILEs and an overview of the studies in the special issue “Large Ensemble Climate Model Simulations: Exploring Natural Variability, Change Signals and Impacts”. These studies analyse a range of different types of SMILEs including global climate models (GCMs), regionally downscaled climate models (RCMs), a hydrological model with input from a RCM SMILE, a SMILE with prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) built for event attribution, a SMILE that assimilates observed data, and an initialised regional model. These studies provide novel methods, that can be used with SMILEs. The methods published in this issue include a snapshot empirical orthogonal function analysis used to investigate El Niño–Southern Oscillation teleconnections; the partitioning of future uncertainty into model differences, internal variability, and scenario choices; a weighting scheme for multi-model ensembles that can incorporate SMILEs; and a method to identify the required ensemble size for any given problem. Studies in this special issue also focus on RCM SMILEs, with projections of the North Atlantic Oscillation and its regional impacts assessed over Europe, and an RCM SMILE intercomparison. Finally a subset of studies investigate projected impacts of global warming, with increased water ﬂows projected for future hydrometeorological events in southern Ontario; precipitation projections over central Europe are investigated and found to be inconsistent across models in the Alps, with a continuation of past tendencies in Mid-Europe; and equatorial Asia is found to have an increase in the probability of large ﬁre and drought events under higher levels of warming. These studies demonstrate the utility of different types of SMILEs. In the second part of this editorial we provide a perspective on how three types of SMILEs could be combined to exploit the advantages of each. To do so we use a GCM SMILE and an RCM SMILE with all forcings, as well as a naturally forced GCM SMILE (nat-GCM) over the European domain. We utilise one of the key advantages of SMILEs, precisely separating the forced response and internal variability within an individual model to investigate a variety of simple questions. Broadly we show that the GCM can be used to investigate broad-scale patterns and can be directly compared to the nat-GCM to attribute forced changes to either anthropogenic emissions or volcanoes. The RCM provides high-resolution spatial information of both the forced change and the internal variability around this change at different warming levels. By combining all three ensembles we can gain information that would not be available using a single type of SMILE alone, providing a perspective on future research that could be undertaken using these tools.},

            This study presents a climatology of water vapor fluxes for the eastern United States and adjacent Atlantic with particular focus on the Northeast. Pathways of moisture transport comprising this climatology were discerned using a self-organizing map methodology ingesting daily integrated vapor transport data from ECMWF ERA-Interim Reanalysis from 1979 to 2017 at a 2.5° × 2.5° spatial resolution. Sixteen spatially distinct moisture transport patterns capture the variety of water vapor transport in the region. The climatology of water vapor transport is precisely and comprehensively defined via synthesis of spatial and temporal characteristics of the fluxes. Each flux has a distinct seasonality and frequency. The fluxes containing the highest amounts of moisture transport occur less frequently than those with less moisture transport. Because the patterns showing less moisture transport are prevalent, they are major contributors to the manner in which water vapor is moved through the eastern United States. The spatial confinement of fluxes is inversely related to persistence, with strong, narrow bands of enhanced moisture transport most often moving through the region on daily time scales. Many moisture fluxes meet a threshold-based definition of atmospheric rivers, with the diversity in trajectories and moisture sources indicating that a variety of mechanisms develop these enhanced moisture transport conditions. Temporal variability in the monthly frequencies of several of the fluxes in this study aligns with changes in the regional precipitation regime, demonstrating that this water vapor flux climatology provides a precise moisture-delivery framework from which changes in precipitation can be investigated.},

            Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are mechanisms of strong moisture transport capable of bringing heavy precipitation to the West Coast of North America, which drives water resources and can lead to large‐scale flooding. Understanding links between climate variability and landfalling ARs is critical for improving forecasts on timescales needed for water resource management. We examined 69 years of landfalling ARs along western North America using reanalysis and a long‐term AR catalog to identify circulation drivers of AR landfalls. This analysis reveals that AR activity along the West Coast is largely associated with a handful of influential modes of atmospheric variability. Interaction between these modes creates favorable or unfavorable atmospheric states for landfalling ARs at different locations, effectively steering moisture plumes up and down the coast from Mexico to British Columbia. Seasonal persistence of certain modes helps explain interannual variability of landfalling ARs, including recent California drought years and the wet winter of 2016/2017.
          , 
            Plain Language Summary
            Understanding links between large‐scale climate variability and landfalling ARs is important for improving subseasonal‐to‐seasonal (S2S) predictability of water resources in the western United States. We have analyzed a seven‐decade‐long catalog of ARs impacting western North America to quantify synoptic influence on AR activity. Our results identify dominant circulation patterns associated with landfalling ARs and show how seasonal variation in the prevalence of certain circulation features modulates the frequency of AR landfalls at different latitudes in a given year. AR variability played an important role in the recent California drought as well as the wet winter of 2016/2017, and we show how this variability was associated with the relative frequency of favorable versus unfavorable atmospheric states.

	abstract = {Numerical weather prediction ensembles are routinely used for operational weather forecasting. The members of these ensembles are individual simulations with either slightly perturbed initial conditions or different model parameterizations, or occasionally both. Multi-member ensemble output is usually large, multivariate, and challenging to interpret interactively. Forecast meteorologists are interested in understanding the uncertainties associated with numerical weather prediction; speciﬁcally variability between the ensemble members. Currently, visualization of ensemble members is mostly accomplished through spaghetti plots of a single midtroposphere pressure surface height contour. In order to explore new uncertainty visualization methods, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to create a 48-hour, 18 member parameterization ensemble of the 13 March 1993 “Superstorm”. A tool was designed to interactively explore the ensemble uncertainty of three important weather variables: water-vapor mixing ratio, perturbation potential temperature, and perturbation pressure. Uncertainty was quantiﬁed using individual ensemble member standard deviation, inter-quartile range, and the width of the 95\% conﬁdence interval. Bootstrapping was employed to overcome the dependence on normality in the uncertainty metrics. A coordinated view of ribbon and glyph-based uncertainty visualization, spaghetti plots, iso-pressure colormaps, and data transect plots was provided to two meteorologists for expert evaluation. They found it useful in assessing uncertainty in the data, especially in ﬁnding outliers in the ensemble run and therefore avoiding the WRF parameterizations that lead to these outliers. Additionally, the meteorologists could identify spatial regions where the uncertainty was signiﬁcantly high, allowing for identiﬁcation of poorly simulated storm environments and physical interpretation of these model issues.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Northeast Atlantic possesses an energetic and variable wind and wave
climate which has a large potential for renewable energy extraction; for
example along the western seaboards off Ireland. The role of surface winds in
the generation of ocean waves means that global atmospheric circulation
patterns and wave climate characteristics are inherently connected. In
quantifying how the wave and wind climate of this region may change towards
the end of the century due to climate change, it is useful to investigate the
influence of large scale atmospheric oscillations using indices such as the
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East Atlantic pattern (EA) and the
Scandinavian pattern (SCAND). In this study a statistical analysis of these
teleconnections was carried out using an ensemble of EC-Earth global climate
simulations run under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 forcing scenarios, where EC-Earth
is a European-developed atmosphere ocean sea-ice coupled climate model. In
addition, EC-Earth model fields were used to drive the WAVEWATCH III wave
model over the North Atlantic basin to create the highest resolution wave
projection dataset currently available for Ireland. Using this dataset we
analysed the correlations between teleconnections and significant wave
heights (Hs) with a particular focus on extreme ocean states using a range
of statistical methods. The strongest, statistically significant correlations
exist between the 95th percentile of significant wave height and the NAO.
Correlations between extreme Hs and the EA and SCAND are weaker and not
statistically significant over parts of the North Atlantic. When the NAO is
in its positive phase (NAO+) and the EA and SCAND are in a negative phase
(EA−, SCAND−) the strongest effects are seen on 20-year return levels of
extreme ocean waves. Under RCP8.5 there are large areas around Ireland where
the 20-year return level of Hs increases by the end of the century,
despite an overall decreasing trend in mean wind speeds and hence mean Hs.},

            The variability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and its governing processes during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is investigated in the Kiel Climate Model. Under LGM conditions, multidecadal AMOC variability is mainly forced by the surface heat flux variability linked to the East Atlantic pattern (EAP). In contrast, the multidecadal AMOC variability under preindustrial conditions is mainly driven by the surface heat flux variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation. Stand‐alone atmosphere model experiments show that relative to preindustrial conditions, the change in AMOC forcing under LGM conditions is tightly linked to the differences in topography.
          , 
            Plain Language Summary
            The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, about 21,000 years before present) was a period when extensive continental ice sheets covered parts of North America and northern Europe. A climate model simulates enhanced multidecadal variability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), a major oceanic current system with global climatic impacts, during the LGM relative to modern times. The main driver of multidecadal AMOC variability under LGM conditions is the surface heat flux variability associated with the East Atlantic pattern, a mode of internal atmospheric variability. Under modern conditions, the main driver of the multidecadal AMOC variability is the heat flux variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, another mode of internal atmospheric variability. The difference in AMOC forcing is basically due to the change in topography linked to the extensive ice sheets during the LGM.

	abstract = {The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is known to inﬂuence precipitation δ18O (δ18Op) through its control on air temperature and on the trajectory of the westerly winds that carry moisture onto Europe during boreal winters. Hence, paleoclimate studies seeking to reconstruct the NAO can exploit the δ18O signal that is commonly preserved in natural archives such as stalagmites, ice cores, tree rings and lake sediments. However, such reconstructions should consider the uncertainties that arise from non-stationarities in the δ18Op-NAO relationship. Here, new insights into the causes of these temporal non-stationarities are presented for the European region using both observations (GNIP database) and the output of an isotope-enabled general circulation model (ECHAM5-wiso). The results show that, although the East Atlantic (EA) pattern is generally uncorrelated to δ18Op during the instrumental period, its polarity affects the δ18Op-NAO relationship. Non-stationarities in this relationship result from spatial shifts of the δ18Op-NAO correlated areas as a consequence of different NAO/EA combinations. These shifts are consistent with those reported previously for NAO-winter climate variables and the resulting non-stationarities mean that δ18O-based NAO reconstructions could be compromised if the balance of positive and negative NAO/EA states differs substantially in a calibration period compared with the period of interest in the past. The same approach has been followed to assess the relationships between δ18Op and both winter total precipitation and winter mean surface air temperature, with similar results. Crucially, this study also identiﬁes regions within Europe where temporal changes in the NAO, air temperature and precipitation can be more robustly reconstructed using δ18O time series from natural archives, irrespective of concomitant changes in the EA.},

	abstract = {Abstract. By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions:  – How does the Earth system respond to forcing? – What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?  – How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

It is found that the two major modes (EOF1 and EOF2) of the water vapor source and sink anomalies over the TEIOWP present a southwest-northeast oriented dipole and a southwest-northeast oriented tripole. Specifically, when the western maritime continent shows an anomalous water vapor source, the northwestern Pacific is characterized by anomalous water vapor sink and source in EOF1 and EOF2 modes, respectively. The EOF1 and EOF2 modes are primarily driven by a single and a double meridional cell anomaly, which corresponds to the in-phase and out-of-phase linkage between evaporation anomalies over the western maritime continent and precipitation anomalies over the northwestern Pacific, respectively. Furthermore, the EOF1 mode is regulated by the quick transition of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phase, whereas the EOF2 mode probably originates from internal atmospheric variability. Considering that the standard deviation of PC1 is much higher during ENSO years than that during non-ENSO years, it is probable that the water source and sink anomalies over the TEIOWP tend to be dominant by EOF1 mode during ENSO years. In contrast, the EOF2 mode may play an important role in the water source and sink anomalies over the TEIOWP during non-ENSO years. Accordingly, the water vapor source and sink anomalies over the TEIOWP may be well predicted based on the ENSO state in the previous December-January-February. These results are useful for understanding the predictability of water vapor source and sink anomalies over the TEIOWP.},

The results show that two major modes of anomalous water vapour transport over the tropical Indian Ocean–western Pacific (60°–140°E, 10°S–30°N) experienced a significant inter‐decadal change in the mid‐1980s. The first mode (EOF1) shows that the anticyclonic water vapour transport over the northwestern Pacific moves significantly southwards after the mid‐1980s. Before the mid‐1980s, the anomalous water vapour originates from the subtropical western Pacific and moves through the South China Sea to eastern China. However, the anomalous water vapour mainly originates from the tropical western Pacific and moves through the South China Sea to eastern China after the mid‐1980s. The second mode (EOF2) reflects the enhanced effect of the anomalous water vapour transport over the tropical Indian Ocean on East Asia after the mid‐1980s. Before the mid‐1980s, the distribution of the water vapour anomalies is uneven over the tropical Indian Ocean and the magnitude of water vapour is relatively small, so it has a weak effect on rainfall over East Asia. After the mid‐1980s, anomalous anticyclonic water vapour transport originates from the tropical Indian Ocean and moves along the Arabia Sea, Indian Peninsula and Indo‐China Peninsula and then forms an anomalous cyclonic water vapour transport over south China. Furthermore, the possible causes of the inter‐decadal transition in anomalous water vapour transport are investigated for the two major modes. The significant inter‐decadal transition in anomalous water vapour transport is associated with the enhanced effect of the sea surface temperature (SST). Before the mid‐1980s, the relationships between the two major modes and the SST of the tropical oceans are relatively weak. After the mid‐1980s, the EOF1 becomes significantly regulated by the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the previous winter, and the positive (negative) phase of the principal component of the first mode (PC1) corresponds to significantly positive (negative) SST anomalies over the tropical northern Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent during the same period. For EOF2, the anomalous water vapour transport over the tropical Indian Ocean is related to the enhanced inter‐annual variability of tropical Indian Ocean dipole (TIOD) after the mid‐1980s.},

Quantities such as the standard deviation of filtered geopotential height, one-point correlation maps and Z300–Z500 and Z500–Z700 thicknesses, related to the intensity and typical paths of baroclinic disturbances, were also computed to help in the interpretation of the results. It is clear that the leading mode of Mediterranean precipitation has its roots in the dynamics of the Atlantic storm track and the associated moisture transports. The second mode represents the internal redistribution of moisture inside the Mediterranean basin. Moisture is supplied to the atmosphere in the western Mediterranean, and this moisture is transported and precipitates over the eastern Mediterranean (mainly Turkey and Greece). Finally, the third mode depends on the role of European topography as a blocking factor for westerly moisture transport advected from the North Atlantic region.},

	abstract = {Abstract The summer moisture transport by the large-scale circulation over China has been investigated using ECMWF–WMO twice-daily analyses for the period 1980–96. The horizontal flux of atmospheric water vapor and its divergence has been calculated over two target regions, namely, southeast China (25°–35°N, 110°–120°E) and northeast China (40°–50°N, 120°–130°E). The time-averaged fluxes show the southeastern Asian and Indian monsoon circulations bringing abundant moisture from the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal, respectively, to southeast China while the midlatitude westerlies dominate the moisture transport over northeast China. The association between the interannual variations of moisture flux and rainfall over China has been examined. The comparison of the fluxes for wet and dry years over the southeast showed there to be, for the former, much stronger moisture transport by the southeastern Asian monsoon through the southern boundary but little change associated with transport by the Indian monsoon. Furthermore, comparison between mean and transient eddy transport budgets in wet and dry years and in the climatological mean shows that the mean component is dominant in the total transport. The moisture convergence associated with the transient eddies assumes its largest values in the eastern part of the country and, for the most part, assumes a sign opposite to that of the moisture flux convergence associated with the time-mean circulation and moisture fields. The results of this study suggest that the transient eddies do not play a significant role in the initiation and maintenance of the abnormal climate events over the two domains used in the study. Over both of these domains the two largest terms in the climatological moisture budget are seen to be the evaporation and the precipitation, while for interannual variations the largest terms are the atmospheric moisture convergence and the precipitation. China has the largest irrigated area in the world and much of this is in the form of flooded paddy fields. It is suggested that this large area of saturated surface may result in evapotranspiration rates that differ significantly from those implied by atlases that have used estimates obtained at “typical” locations. The extent of irrigation over China may also make the task of interpreting its moisture budget more difficult.},

The differences of water vapor between RegCM3‐POM and RegCM3 are mainly caused by different winds in the middle and low troposphere. The simulated circulation pattern of RegCM3‐POM is more similar to the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data than that of the uncoupled model. The simulated geopotential height and the gradient of geopotential height in the coupled model are more accurate than those in the uncoupled model. The real‐time and lead–lag relationship between geopotential height and sea surface temperature (SST) in RegCM3‐POM is consistent with that between the height of CFSR data and HadISST (Hadley Center Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature data). Thus, the simulated water vapor in the lower troposphere and the vertically integrated moisture transport are more accurate in the coupled model than in RegCM3. In addition, the correlation coefficients between moisture transport and SST in RegCM3 are positive in South China Sea, corresponding to SST forcing; the correlation coefficients in RegCM3‐POM are negative, which is consistent with that between the vapor transport in CFSR data and HadISST. Thus, the air–sea coupled model represents more accurately than the uncoupled model the relationship between SST and moisture transport.

            The summer moisture circulation anomaly over East Asia and the western North Pacific (WNP) couples well with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in a quasi-4-yr period. The moisture circulation is dominated by two well-separated modes. The first mode exhibits an anticyclonic (cyclonic) moisture circulation over tropical–subtropical East Asia–WNP with an easterly (westerly) transport over the tropical WNP–Indian Ocean; the second mode displays an alternating pattern with an anticyclonic (cyclonic) moisture circulation over the subtropical WNP layered between two cyclonic (anticyclonic) circulations. Both modes couple well with the ENSO signal during its quasi-4-yr cycle. Within the cycle, in the summer of a developing warm episode, the positive phase of the second mode plays a key role, while in the transitional summer between a decaying warm episode and a developing cool episode, the positive phase of the first mode tends to take effect. In the summer of a developing cool episode, the negative phase of the second mode plays an important role, while the negative phase of the first mode tends to take effect in the transitional summer between a decaying cool episode and a developing warm episode.
            The anticyclone (cyclone) over the Philippine Sea region serves as a bridge in the quasi-four-year coupling. Its establishment and eastward extension modify moisture circulation over East Asia–WNP. Conversely, the easterly (westerly) wind to the south of the anticyclone (cyclone) is beneficial for the formation and eastward propagation of the Kelvin wave and, hence, to the development of the quasi-4-yr periodic ENSO episode.},

            The vertically integrated water vapor transport (IVT) over the Pacific–North American sector during three phases of ENSO in boreal winter (December–February) is investigated using IVT values calculated from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) during 1979–2010. The shift of the location and sign of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean leads to different atmospheric responses and thereby changes the seasonal mean moisture transport into North America. During eastern Pacific El Niño (EPEN) events, large positive IVT anomalies extend northeastward from the subtropical Pacific into the northwestern United States following the anomalous cyclonic flow around a deeper Aleutian low, while a southward shift of the cyclonic circulation during central Pacific El Niño (CPEN) events induces the transport of moisture into the southwestern United States. In addition, moisture from the eastern tropical Pacific is transported from the deep tropical eastern Pacific into Mexico and the southwestern United States during CPEN. During La Niña (NINA), the seasonal mean IVT anomaly is opposite to that of two El Niño phases. Analyses of 6-hourly IVT anomalies indicate that there is strong moisture transport from the North Pacific into the northwestern and southwestern United States during EPEN and CPEN, respectively. The IVT is maximized on the southeastern side of a low located over the eastern North Pacific, where the low is weaker but located farther south and closer to shore during CPEN than during EPEN. Moisture enters the southwestern United States from the eastern tropical Pacific during NINA via anticyclonic circulation associated with a ridge over the southern United States.},

            This study presents a climatology of water vapor fluxes for the eastern United States and adjacent Atlantic with particular focus on the Northeast. Pathways of moisture transport comprising this climatology were discerned using a self-organizing map methodology ingesting daily integrated vapor transport data from ECMWF ERA-Interim Reanalysis from 1979 to 2017 at a 2.5° × 2.5° spatial resolution. Sixteen spatially distinct moisture transport patterns capture the variety of water vapor transport in the region. The climatology of water vapor transport is precisely and comprehensively defined via synthesis of spatial and temporal characteristics of the fluxes. Each flux has a distinct seasonality and frequency. The fluxes containing the highest amounts of moisture transport occur less frequently than those with less moisture transport. Because the patterns showing less moisture transport are prevalent, they are major contributors to the manner in which water vapor is moved through the eastern United States. The spatial confinement of fluxes is inversely related to persistence, with strong, narrow bands of enhanced moisture transport most often moving through the region on daily time scales. Many moisture fluxes meet a threshold-based definition of atmospheric rivers, with the diversity in trajectories and moisture sources indicating that a variety of mechanisms develop these enhanced moisture transport conditions. Temporal variability in the monthly frequencies of several of the fluxes in this study aligns with changes in the regional precipitation regime, demonstrating that this water vapor flux climatology provides a precise moisture-delivery framework from which changes in precipitation can be investigated.},

The differences of water vapor between RegCM3‐POM and RegCM3 are mainly caused by different winds in the middle and low troposphere. The simulated circulation pattern of RegCM3‐POM is more similar to the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data than that of the uncoupled model. The simulated geopotential height and the gradient of geopotential height in the coupled model are more accurate than those in the uncoupled model. The real‐time and lead–lag relationship between geopotential height and sea surface temperature (SST) in RegCM3‐POM is consistent with that between the height of CFSR data and HadISST (Hadley Center Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature data). Thus, the simulated water vapor in the lower troposphere and the vertically integrated moisture transport are more accurate in the coupled model than in RegCM3. In addition, the correlation coefficients between moisture transport and SST in RegCM3 are positive in South China Sea, corresponding to SST forcing; the correlation coefficients in RegCM3‐POM are negative, which is consistent with that between the vapor transport in CFSR data and HadISST. Thus, the air–sea coupled model represents more accurately than the uncoupled model the relationship between SST and moisture transport.

            The summer moisture circulation anomaly over East Asia and the western North Pacific (WNP) couples well with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in a quasi-4-yr period. The moisture circulation is dominated by two well-separated modes. The first mode exhibits an anticyclonic (cyclonic) moisture circulation over tropical–subtropical East Asia–WNP with an easterly (westerly) transport over the tropical WNP–Indian Ocean; the second mode displays an alternating pattern with an anticyclonic (cyclonic) moisture circulation over the subtropical WNP layered between two cyclonic (anticyclonic) circulations. Both modes couple well with the ENSO signal during its quasi-4-yr cycle. Within the cycle, in the summer of a developing warm episode, the positive phase of the second mode plays a key role, while in the transitional summer between a decaying warm episode and a developing cool episode, the positive phase of the first mode tends to take effect. In the summer of a developing cool episode, the negative phase of the second mode plays an important role, while the negative phase of the first mode tends to take effect in the transitional summer between a decaying cool episode and a developing warm episode.
            The anticyclone (cyclone) over the Philippine Sea region serves as a bridge in the quasi-four-year coupling. Its establishment and eastward extension modify moisture circulation over East Asia–WNP. Conversely, the easterly (westerly) wind to the south of the anticyclone (cyclone) is beneficial for the formation and eastward propagation of the Kelvin wave and, hence, to the development of the quasi-4-yr periodic ENSO episode.},

	abstract = {This study presents a climatology of water vapor fluxes for the eastern United States and adjacent Atlantic with particular focus on the Northeast. Pathways of moisture transport comprising this climatology were discerned using a self-organizing map methodology ingesting daily integrated vapor transport data from ECMWF ERA-Interim Reanalysis from 1979 to 2017 at a 2.5° × 2.5° spatial resolution. Sixteen spatially distinct moisture transport patterns capture the variety of water vapor transport in the region. The climatology of water vapor transport is precisely and comprehensively defined via synthesis of spatial and temporal characteristics of the fluxes. Each flux has a distinct seasonality and frequency. The fluxes containing the highest amounts of moisture transport occur less frequently than those with less moisture transport. Because the patterns showing less moisture transport are prevalent, they are major contributors to the manner in which water vapor is moved through the eastern United States. The spatial confinement of fluxes is inversely related to persistence, with strong, narrow bands of enhanced moisture transport most often moving through the region on daily time scales. Many moisture fluxes meet a threshold-based definition of atmospheric rivers, with the diversity in trajectories and moisture sources indicating that a variety of mechanisms develop these enhanced moisture transport conditions. Temporal variability in the monthly frequencies of several of the fluxes in this study aligns with changes in the regional precipitation regime, demonstrating that this water vapor flux climatology provides a precise moisture-delivery framework from which changes in precipitation can be investigated.},

	abstract = {A methodology for choosing a hybrid σ–p (sigma–pressure) vertical coordinate of the Simmons–Strüfing form for a global model is presented. The method focuses on properties of the vertical derivative of the terrain-following coefficient, which affect the smoothness and shape of layer thickness profiles and determines the coordinate’s monotonicity over variable terrain. The method is applied to characterize and interrelate existing hybrid coordinate choices in NWP and climate models, then to design new coordinates with specific properties. Offline tests indicate that the new coordinates reduce stratospheric errors in models due to vertical truncation effects in the computation of the pressure gradient force over steep terrain. When implemented in a global model, the new coordinates significantly reduce vorticity and divergence errors at all altitudes in idealized simulations. In forecasting experiments with a global model, the new coordinates slightly reduce the stability of the semi-implicit time scheme. Resetting the reference pressure in the scheme to ∼800 hPa solves the problem for every coordinate except the Sangster–Arakawa–Lamb hybrid, which remains intrinsically less stable than the others. Impacts of different coordinates on forecast skill are neutral or weakly positive, with the new hybrid coordinates yielding slight improvements relative to earlier hybrid choices. This essentially neutral impact indirectly endorses the wide variety of hybrid coordinate choices currently used in NWP and climate models, with the proviso that these tests do not address the impact over longer time scales or on data assimilation.},

The globally averaged ocean surface temperature shows a mean warming trend of 0.062 ± 0.013oC/decade over the last 120 years. During the last decade the rate of ocean surface warming has accelerated to 0.280 ± 0.068oC/decade (4.5 times higher). Ocean Heat Content in the upper 2000m shows a warming rate of 0.35 ± 0.08W/m2 in the period 1955-2019. The mean increase rate of OHC during the last decade is twice as high (0.70 ± 0.07W/m2) as the long term mean. Global surface ocean pH has declined by approximately 0.1 since the industrial revolution. By the end of this century ocean pH is projected to decline additionally by 0.1 to 0.4 pH units. The time of emergence of the signal varies from 8 to 15 years for open ocean sites, and 16 to 41 years for coastal sites. Global dissolved oxygen levels have decreased by 4.8 petamoles or 2\% in the last 5 decades, with profound impacts on local and basin scale habitats. Arctic sea ice extent is declining by -13.1\% per decade during summer and by -2.6 \% per decade during winter. The combined trends of sea ice extent and sea ice thickness indicate that the volume of non-seasonal Arctic Sea Ice has decreased by 75\% since 1979 to 2020. Global mean sea level has increased in the period 1993-2019 at a mean rate of 3.15 ± 0.3 mm/yr and is experiencing an acceleration of {\textasciitilde} 0.084 (0.06-0.10) mm/yr2. Satellite altimetry also reveals strong regional variability in the rates of sea level change. Proxies of the evolution of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation indicate that AMOC is at its weakest for several hundreds of years and has been slowing down during the last century.

Our results suggest that the 14-year RAPID length has just entered the lower limits of the trend's “detection window” based on synthetic data generated using CMIP5 trends and variability (14–42 years; median 24 years), but twice the length is required for detectability based on RAPID variability (29–67 years; median 43 years).

            Hundreds of petabytes are produced annually at weather and climate forecast centers worldwide. Compression is essential to reduce storage and to facilitate data sharing. Current techniques do not distinguish the real from the false information in data, leaving the level of meaningful precision unassessed. Here we define the bitwise real information content from information theory for the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS). Most variables contain fewer than 7 bits of real information per value and are highly compressible due to spatio-temporal correlation. Rounding bits without real information to zero facilitates lossless compression algorithms and encodes the uncertainty within the data itself. All CAMS data are 17× compressed relative to 64-bit floats, while preserving 99\% of real information. Combined with four-dimensional compression, factors beyond 60× are achieved. A data compression Turing test is proposed to optimize compressibility while minimizing information loss for the end use of weather and climate forecast data.},

	abstract = {There has been a long debate on the extent to which precipitation relies on terrestrial evaporation (moisture recycling). In the past, most research focused on moisture recycling within a certain region only. This study makes use of new definitions of moisture recycling to study the complete process of continental moisture feedback. Global maps are presented identifying regions that rely heavily on recycled moisture as well as those that are supplying the moisture. An accounting procedure based on ERA‐Interim reanalysis data is used to calculate moisture recycling ratios. It is computed that, on average, 40\% of the terrestrial precipitation originates from land evaporation and that 57\% of all terrestrial evaporation returns as precipitation over land. Moisture evaporating from the Eurasian continent is responsible for 80\% of China's water resources. In South America, the Río de la Plata basin depends on evaporation from the Amazon forest for 70\% of its water resources. The main source of rainfall in the Congo basin is moisture evaporated over East Africa, particularly the Great Lakes region. The Congo basin in its turn is a major source of moisture for rainfall in the Sahel. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that due to the local orography, local moisture recycling is a key process near the Andes and the Tibetan Plateau. Overall, this paper demonstrates the important role of global wind patterns, topography and land cover in continental moisture recycling patterns and the distribution of global water resources.},

The purpose of this study is to examine the water vapor content of the troposphere over Europe and the Northern Atlantic. Both temporal and spatial differences were examined for total column water vapor (TCWV) and vertically integrated water vapor flux (IWVF) based on ERA-Interim reanalysis data. The statistical relationship between circulation patterns, as expressed by empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes, and TCWV were examined, as were statistical relationships between distinguished advection types and TCWV and IWVF. The study confirmed the significance of atmospheric circulation in the formation of moisture content in the winter season (i.e., January) and its markedly lower impact in other seasons. The relationships noted in the study are characterized by statistically significant spatial differentiation. Spatial pattern analysis was used to identify six regions with different moisture content over the course of the year. The boundaries of the regions confirm the significant role of local factors impacting moisture content.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems are undergoing rapid change at local and global scales. To understand these changes, including the relative roles of natural variability and anthropogenic effects, and to predict the future state of marine ecosystems requires quantitative understanding of the physics, biogeochemistry and ecology of oceanic systems at mechanistic levels. Central to this understanding is the role played by dominant patterns or “modes” of atmospheric and oceanic variability, which orchestrate coherent variations in climate over large regions with profound impacts on ecosystems. We review the spatial structure of extratropical climate variability over the Northern Hemisphere and, specifically, focus on modes of climate variability over the extratropical North Atlantic. A leading pattern of weather and climate variability over the Northern Hemisphere is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO refers to a redistribution of atmospheric mass between the Arctic and the subtropical Atlantic, and swings from one phase to another producing large changes in surface air temperature, winds, storminess and precipitation over the Atlantic as well as the adjacent continents. The NAO also affects the ocean through changes in heat content, gyre circulations, mixed layer depth, salinity, high latitude deep water formation and sea ice cover. Thus, indices of the NAO have become widely used to document and understand how this mode of variability alters the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. There is no unique way, however, to define the NAO. Several approaches are discussed including both linear (e.g., principal component analysis) and nonlinear (e.g., cluster analysis) techniques. The former, which have been most widely used, assume preferred atmospheric circulation states come in pairs, in which anomalies of opposite polarity have the same spatial structure. In contrast, nonlinear techniques search for recurrent patterns of a specific amplitude and sign. They reveal, for instance, spatial asymmetries between different phases of the NAO that are likely important for ecological studies. It also follows that there is no universally accepted index to describe the temporal evolution of the NAO. Several of the most common measures are presented and compared. All reveal that there is no preferred time scale of variability for the NAO: large changes occur from one winter to the next and from one decade to the next. There is also a large amount of within-season variability in the patterns of atmospheric circulation of the North Atlantic, so that most winters cannot be characterized solely by a canonical NAO structure. A better understanding of how the NAO responds to external forcing, including sea surface temperature changes in the tropics, stratospheric influences, and increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, is crucial to the current debate on climate variability and change.},

A substantial portion is associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a hemispheric meridional oscillation in atmospheric mass with centers of action near Iceland and over the subtropical Atlantic. NAO-related impacts on winter climate extend from Florida to Greenland and from northwestern Africa over Europe far into northern Asia. Over the last 3 decades, the phase of the NAO has been shifting from mostly negative to mostly positive index values. Much remains to be learned about the mechanisms that produce such low frequency changes in the North Atlantic climate, but it seems increasingly likely that human activities are playing a significant role.},

	abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau (TP), being an average of surpassing 4000 m above sea level and around 2.5 × 106 km2, is the highest and largest plateau in the world and also called as the “Third Pole”. Due to its elevated land surface and complex terrain, the TP is subjected to combined regulations of multiple climate systems and associated large-scale atmospheric circulations. In this paper, we comprehensively review the recent studies of atmospheric moisture transport versus precipitation across the TP, with the attempt to link the two, which did not receive much attention previously. This review focuses on the atmospheric moisture transport and associated circulation patterns in this region, widely adopted approaches to identify the atmospheric moisture transport, qualitative and quantitative analyses for the role of water vapor transport on the precipitation, as well as the internal physical mechanism between atmospheric moisture transport and precipitation over the TP. Moreover, directions of future research are discussed based on the following aspects, which include 1) proposing an integrated statistical-physical framework for demonstrating the influence of atmospheric moisture transport and associated circulation patterns on the precipitation, especially the extremes, in the high-cold mountainous region; 2) quantifying the contribution of atmospheric water vapor from the surrounding sources as well as the local moisture recycling on the TP's precipitation; 3) providing higher quality data for atmospheric water vapor and precipitation; 4) emphasizing on the physical mechanism sustaining the atmospheric moisture transport as well as its potential influence on the extreme precipitation, including amount, frequency, intensity and duration. It is expected that this review will be beneficial for exploring the linkage between atmospheric moisture transport versus precipitation across the TP.},
