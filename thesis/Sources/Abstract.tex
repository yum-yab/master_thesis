The distribution and variability of precipitation in Europe are significantly influenced by moisture transport over the north(east)ern Atlantic.
The objective of my master thesis is to analyze the evolution of moisture transport patterns in various future climate scenarios.
The foundation of this research lies in the MPI-GE, the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble Dataset, comprising an ensemble of 100 members for different RCP (climate) scenarios up until 2100.
Each member provides multiple fields of relevant climate data.
A challenge will be the visualization of uncertainty stemming from 100 different simulations, which will not be straightforward.

To quantify moisture transport, an integrated water vapor transport (a combination of wind and specific moisture) scalar/vector field will be generated from the MPI-GE.
Windowed Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) will be used to extract spatial-temporal patterns and simplify the data, making it easier to evaluate pattern evolution over time.
