abstract = {A gridded monthly and pentad precipitation for 1979–2001 from the Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) data set and terrestrial monthly gauge-based precipitation for 1958–1998 from the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia (CRU), data set are used to investigate seasonality in the long- and short-term precipitation variability over Europe. Prominent seasonal differences are detected both in precipitation climatologies and in characteristics of precipitation variability. It is shown that over western Europe the summer precipitation climatology and its year-to-year variability (expressed by standard deviations) are lower than those of the winter precipitation. Major seasonal differences are found over central eastern Europe. In this region the summer precipitation climatology and magnitudes of its interannual variability exceed respective winter characteristics by a factor of 2–3.5. Similar relationships are found for the summer and winter magnitudes of intraseasonal fluctuations of precipitation. The first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes of both summer and winter seasonal mean precipitation over Europe are associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, they explain very different (42\% for winter and 25\% for summer) fractions of total precipitation variability and form principally different spatial patterns. Temporal behavior of the respective principal components is also essentially different. The first EOF mode of the winter magnitudes of intraseasonal precipitation fluctuations is also associated with the NAO. The second EOF mode of the winter precipitation is linked to the East Atlantic teleconnection pattern. However, the respective mode in the magnitudes of intraseasonal fluctuations was not detected. The second EOF mode of the summer precipitation is associated with the 500 hPa heights pattern, which is characterized by four anomaly centers. Two major centers of opposite polarity are located over western Europe and Scandinavia-northeastern European Russia.},

abstract = {Abstract The Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE) is the largest ensemble of a single comprehensive climate model currently available, with 100 members for the historical simulations (1850–2005) and four forcing scenarios. It is currently the only large ensemble available that includes scenario representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and a 1\% CO2 scenario. These advantages make MPI-GE a powerful tool. We present an overview of MPI-GE, its components, and detail the experiments completed. We demonstrate how to separate the forced response from internal variability in a large ensemble. This separation allows the quantification of both the forced signal under climate change and the internal variability to unprecedented precision. We then demonstrate multiple ways to evaluate MPI-GE and put observations in the context of a large ensemble, including a novel approach for comparing model internal variability with estimated observed variability. Finally, we present four novel analyses, which can only be completed using a large ensemble. First, we address whether temperature and precipitation have a pathway dependence using the forcing scenarios. Second, the forced signal of the highly noisy atmospheric circulation is computed, and different drivers are identified to be important for the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions. Third, we use the ensemble dimension to investigate the time dependency of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation variability changes under global warming. Last, sea level pressure is used as an example to demonstrate how MPI-GE can be utilized to estimate the ensemble size needed for a given scientific problem and provide insights for future ensemble projects.},

abstract = {Abstract Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding the water cycle change under a warming climate is essential, particularly the ocean to land moisture transport, which affects the precipitation over land areas and influences society and the ecosystem. Using ERA5 data from 1988 to 2020, the time series of moisture transport and the trend across the boundary of each continent, including Eurasia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctic, Australia, and Greenland, have been investigated. The inflow and outflow sections of the moisture have been identified for each continent. The trends of moisture convergence over Eurasia, Africa, North America, and Antarctic are all positive, with the values of 2.59 &plusmn; 3.12, 2.60 &plusmn; 3.17, 12.98 &plusmn; 2.28, and 0.32 &plusmn; 0.47 (in 106 kg/s/decade), respectively, but only the trend over North America is statistically significant at a 0.1 significance level. The moisture convergence trend of &minus;0.59 &plusmn; 3.63 (in 106 kg/s/decade) over South America is negative but insignificant. The positive trend of 0.10 &plusmn; 0.35 (in 106 kg/s/decade) over Greenland is very weak. The precipitation, evaporation, and moisture convergence are well balanced at middle and low latitudes, but the combination of moisture convergence and evaporation is systematically lower than the precipitation over Antarctic and Greenland. Contributions of evaporation and moisture convergence (or transport) to the continental precipitation vary with the continent, but the moisture convergence dominates the precipitation variability over all continents, and the significant correlation coefficients between the anomaly time series of continental mean moisture convergence and precipitation are higher than 0.8 in all continents.},
