The distribution and variability of precipitation in Europe are significantly influenced by moisture transport over the north(east)ern Atlantic. The objective of my thesis is to analyze the evolution of moisture transport patterns in various future climate scenarios. The foundation of this research lies in the MPI-GE, the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble Dataset, comprising an ensemble of 100 members for different RCP (climate) scenarios up until 2100. Each member provides multiple fields of relevant climate data.

Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a substantial role in moisture transport and are identified using integrated water vapor transport (IVT). The analysis employs Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) to examine changes in spatial patterns of ARs across different climate scenarios and time periods.
