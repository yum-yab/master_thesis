\section{Means of moisture transport}

\subsection{vertically integrated water vapor transport}

As proposed by \citeauthor{AProposedAlgorithmforMoistureFluxesfromAtmosphericRivers} in \cite{AProposedAlgorithmforMoistureFluxesfromAtmosphericRivers}, one way of measuring moisture ($p$) transport is by vertically integrating over the different pressure levels the zonal and meridional fluxes $\overline{pu}$ and $\overline{pv}$. 

An example of using this method can be found in \cite{Ayantobo2021IntegratedMT} with many more references why this method is working well for these kinds of approaches. 
Also this paper lists some other methods of moisture transportation which are also used:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item integrated water vapor distributions (see \cite{gimeno2014atmospheric_rivers_review})
  \item the lagrangian approach
  \item stable oxygen isotope investigation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Empirical Orthogonal Functions}

See \cite{hannachi2007eof_review} for a big overview of EOF in atmospheric science.

See \cite{Ayantobo2021IntegratedMT} for an similar approach as we plan it, except it only focuses on the past
